<h2 id="a-dose-of-pessimist-medicine">A Dose of Pessimist Medicine</h2>

<p>This book is optimistic, but optimism requires confronting reality. Before we act, we need a clear-eyed view of how bad things are. Maintaining an outlook of <em>realistic pessimism</em> about our current predicament can best inform our path ahead. Think of taking small doses of poison to develop immunity. We can’t move forward without a sense of how bad things are. To start, we need to inoculate ourselves with a bitter dose.</p>

<h2 id="deep-adaptation">Deep Adaptation</h2>

<p>Jem Bendell is a Professor who penned the seminal 2018 paper, <em>“Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy.”</em> He is a key figure in defining the burgeoning science of “collapsology”, a genre in which this book is squarely situated. In Deep Adaptation, Bendell argues that climate change is irreversible, and will lead to near-term societal collapse. He also critiques sustainability efforts as insufficient. Bendell’s paper is highly recommended reading, and it started a bit of a movement around accepting just how bad things are, and where we go from here.</p>

<h2 id="sooner-than-expected">“…sooner than expected…”</h2>

<p>Bendell initially drew a lot of criticism for being overly pessimistic in a way that wasn’t supported by actual science at the time. He called collapse inevitable. He was called alarmist and unscientific, dramatic and overly emotional. Time has since proven him to be more correct than we were comfortable admitting at the time. Subsequent climate data and events have lent significant weight to his initially controversial predictions. There’s evidence we’re now in the <em>hot house</em> or runaway warming scenario. Since 2018, many scientific measures of climate change have exceeded earlier predictions. One need only read media about climate with a keen eye for phrases “sooner than anticipated” or “faster than climate models predicted”.</p>

<p>Global average temperature predictions continue to be exceeded by empirical data, and by some accounts we’ve blown past the <span>1.5°C</span> “tipping point” threshold. The latest figures are alarming. Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations continue to rise dramatically, and there is evidence we may be on track for the worst IPCC scenario (<span>8.5°C</span>) increase in global temperatures. These are warming levels on the order of total food system collapse and, according to some scientists, human extinction.</p>

<p>The truth is, even if Bendell’s detractors are incorrect, and ecological and societal collapse isn’t in the cards, it doesn’t necessarily matter from a perspective of readiness. If we’re prepared for the worst, we can take on the coming crises, and help others navigate what is clearly already becoming a more challenging world.</p>

<h2 id="a-realistic-pessimistic-outlook">A Realistic Pessimistic Outlook</h2>

<p>Expanding on the premise of Deep Adaptation, in order to help inform rational decisions about the future, we hold the following pessimistic views:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Climate change is irreversible – even if we stopped all emissions today, the “cake is baked” and the earth would continue to warm from already triggered feedback mechanisms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A period of mass species extinction will continue at an accelerated rate in our lifetimes and we should be mentally and materially prepared for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With perhaps a few isolated exceptions, world governments will not be able to address the coming challenges due to regulatory capture and a proclivity for corruption that will increase as things advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attempted policy changes will make things worse, for example, offering incentives to produce electric cars rather than doing hard things like building new infrastructure or restructuring cities so as not to require the need for as many cars in the first place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitigation will be misguided and go into things like building sea walls or rebuilding in disaster prone areas rather than making a sober “tactical retreat” to more suitable locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Panic will also make things worse. When there’s a perceived sense of scarcity in the air, people will scam, rob, and generally step over each other (and worse) if they feel it helps them obtain material security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wars will intensify in frequency and scale, and cause more fossil fuels to be consumed. We’re already seeing geopolitical instability due to climate, and on top of that, militaries are one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses globally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A technological solution will not materialize to fix the problem. It’s not going to be possible to reverse hundreds of years of industrialized production and capture emissions through direct air capture, advanced weathering, or any other such scheme. We’re nowhere even close to this now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should plan for <em>every last drop of oil</em> to be consumed; at the least, all of the oil that can be easily extracted. (Even if that doesn’t happen, we can plan for the conditions to expect <em>if it did</em>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Successful” mitigations will be undone. Imagine tree planting efforts one year, wiped out by wildfires the next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a similar vein, much of the energy generation added by new renewables will be consumed by wasteful uses like consumer-facing AI and crypto mining.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jevons Paradox and demand for relentless growth will eat efficiency gains in energy use (e.g., more fuel-efficient engines have often led to increased total consumption rather than reduced demand), as the saved resources are used for expansion. As global energy demand continues to rise, especially in emerging economies, any surplus oil is likely to find buyers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social media companies will bury most forms of true climate activism because it’s generally negative for them from a business/engagement perspective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nationalist rhetoric will continue to drown out the kind of international solidarity necessary to combat the most devastating effects of climate change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And finally, climate concerned groups, who could be most effective, will fall into a trap of climate idealism.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="climate-idealism">Climate Idealism</h2>

<p>Many well meaning climate-concerned groups will waste their energy by focusing on weak or ineffective forms of action, like public protests to “raise awareness”, or small actions which will do very little to address the underlying predicament.</p>

<p>These movements fixate on personal choices like using metal straws, or going vegan—as if these could reverse centuries of industrial destruction. These efforts aren’t worthless, but they’re woefully inadequate. They fail to address the true scale of industrial inertia. Many activists prioritize sustainability as a goal. This strikes me as rose-colored idealism. As if we can simply put on a sweater or not eat meat, and that if enough of us do that, the climate monster we’ve unleashed through centuries of industrial production will simply respect our efforts.</p>

<p>We would basically need to build all of our existing oil and gas infrastructure in reverse, to even begin to capture at scale the fossil fuels we’ve already released into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Our pessimism guides us to be more realistic. We need to prioritize survivability over sustainability. Of course, sustainability <em>will emerge naturally</em> from a posture of resilient survivalism, but it’s a matter of principles and framing, and how you go about determining what action is most important to take next.</p>

<p>This is admittedly a lot of pessimism to unpack. We should note that we still champion electrification and support large scale mitigations. There are wonderful macro-level changes underway, such as a meteoric rise in energy production from renewables. We also really hope, like anyone, that a geoengineering or technological solution <em>does</em> materialize to bail us out of this mess. Overall however, we do not assume that large-scale climate mitigation will be achieved in any meaningful sense, and the only tool realistically available to us is local adaptation.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be feeling a bit of dread, and that’s both expected, and completely okay.</p>

<h2 id="existential-dread-in-the-anthropocene">Existential Dread in the Anthropocene</h2>

<p>There’s a feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you wonder what happened to all the insects that used to be around.</p>

<p>Existential dread is not new—philosophers like Kierkegaard and Sartre explored it long before the climate crisis. However, today’s anxieties are amplified by globalized risks such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Climate disasters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mass extinctions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AI threats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political instability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pandemics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Societal collapse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fragile supply chains</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nuclear war</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Food system failures</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>…and the list goes on.</p>

<p>We’ll focus on climate, as it’s the threat that’s most looming and underpins a lot of other crises, but there is no shortage of overlapping concerns that lead to existential feelings of doom, helplessness, and disconnection.</p>

<p>Research suggests that these fears are intensifying in modern society, particularly among younger generations.</p>

<h2 id="the-weight-of-a-vanishing-world-on-children-and-climate-grief">The Weight of a Vanishing World: On Children, and Climate Grief</h2>

<p>Children are enchanted by animals—spellbound by the wild, living poetry of creatures that share our planet. Books line their shelves with lions, whales and toucans painted in impossible colors. The elephants, dolphins, or great apes whose eyes hold fragments of our own humanity. These animals are the first loves of childhood and the heroes of bedtime stories.</p>

<p>Yet every documentary, every article, every whispered warning carries the same refrain: <em>“Due to human activity, their numbers are dwindling… their habitats vanishing… their futures uncertain.”</em> We are raising a generation fluent in loss before they’ve even learned to name it.</p>

<p>What does it do to a child’s heart, to grow up alongside extinction?</p>

<p>We mourn the animals, but we must also mourn the children who will never know them. The ones who will inherit not just a scarred planet, but a loneliness we can scarcely fathom. Such a world is quieter, duller, and infinitely poorer.</p>

<p>Younger people are reporting higher levels of existential dread related to climate change. A 2023 global survey found that 75% of Gen Z respondents feared the future due to environmental collapse, with many questioning whether having children is ethical (Aviv et al., 2023). Another study in <em>Nature Climate Change</em> (2020) linked existential anxiety to <strong>“</strong>solastalgia<strong>“</strong>—emotional distress caused by environmental change (Albrecht et al).</p>

<p>This is the hidden toll of collapse: not just what we lose, but who we become in the absence.</p>

<h2 id="good-news-your-grief-is-not-a-dead-end">Good News: Your Grief Is Not a Dead End</h2>

<p>We’re not here to drown you in despair. If you’re reading this, chances are you already carry the weight of these losses. You know the planet is burning, the ice is melting, and the future we were taught to expect feels like a distant mirage. <em>What we do with this grief</em> is what matters now.</p>

<p>Stanley et al. (<em>“From Anger to Action”</em>) digs into the messy, vital relationship between climate emotions and what comes next. Their findings show not all emotional responses to collapse are created equal. Some emotions can paralyze us, while others can motivate us to more positive actions.</p>

<p>The research is actually telling us that anger is the best medicine for action. We need to de-emphasise the very normal response of mournful sorrow over the loss of our future, and instead, get mad about it. To summarize the findings of the paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Anger is the most adaptive response to climate change, linked to better mental health and increased climate action (both personal and collective).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anxiety &amp; depression are less adaptive, tied to poorer mental health—though depression may still drive collective action, while anxiety often leads to disengagement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These eco-emotions are interconnected; experiencing one can heighten the others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The study suggests anger can motivate action, while anxiety/depression may reduce wellbeing and engagement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So get angry about the inappropriate reactions to our otherwise solvable challenges. Get upset about a promised future, stolen by greed. Get mad and get motivated out of our hopelessness and despair and anxiety.</p>

<p>But what does this mean in terms of concrete action? Everyone seems to agree, Bendell, Stanley, Macy &amp; Johnstone (2012), and even the conventional wisdom: we need to take collective action to assuage our anxieties and feel confident about the future. But what does this mean besides a simplistic truism? What actions are actually viable?</p>

<h2 id="cooperation">Cooperation</h2>

<p>We are told to meet our neighbors, build mutual aid networks, and rely on one another rather than institutions that may fail us. Yet for many, this advice feels hollow. How do we cooperate when we barely know the people around us? When our lives are structured around isolation, long work hours, digital distractions, and the erosion of public spaces can make the idea of meaningful community feel out of reach. The truth is, we have been so thoroughly atomized that we no longer even know how to begin.</p>

<p>The path away from dread and toward self-determination is paved with the formation of small, local groups centered around a tangible goal: building practical resilience. This shared purpose, the ability to withstand and adapt to challenges, provides a concrete focus that can bring people together, transcending ideological divides. No one is truly prepared alone. By organizing around this common concern, people can begin to bridge the gaps that isolation has created. Small groups allow for trust to develop gradually. The act of working together, whether building community gardens, organizing skill-sharing workshops, or establishing local emergency plans, creates natural opportunities for relationships to form.</p>

<p>This approach also sidesteps the paralysis of scale. Many systemic problems feel too vast for individuals to address, leaving people disempowered. But resilience-building is actionable at the local level. It does not require mainstream political consensus or institutional approval, just a willingness to connect with those nearby. Over time, these small networks can grow, interlink, and form the foundation of a more cohesive, resilience strategy. The crisis of isolation cannot be solved overnight, but it can be chipped away at, one connection at a time. By gathering in small groups with a shared focus on resilience, we can rediscover the practical power of cooperation, not as an abstract ideal, but as a lived reality.</p>
