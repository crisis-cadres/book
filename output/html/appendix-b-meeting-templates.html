<h1 id="appendix-b---meeting-templates">Appendix B - Meeting Templates</h1>

<p>This appendix provides a set of adaptable templates for conducting the essential meetings of a Crisis Cadre. Each template is designed to be efficient, participatory, and aligned with the core principles of the Cadre: democratic centralism, subsidiarity, political compartmentalization, and a commitment to evidence-based action.</p>

<p>Cadres should rotate roles like Chair, Secretary, and Timekeeper to distribute responsibility and build experience across the membership. These templates can be codified in the cadre’s bylaws or operating agreement.</p>
