<h3 id="basic-principles">Basic Principles</h3>

<p>Robert’s Rules of Order is a guide for conducting fair and orderly meetings. Its core principles are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Majority Rule</strong> – Decisions are made by a majority vote (&gt;50%).</li>
  <li><strong>Minority Rights</strong> – The rights of those who disagree must be protected.</li>
  <li><strong>Order and Fairness</strong> – Discussions follow structured rules to ensure efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>One Thing at a Time</strong> – Only one topic is discussed at once.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roles-in-a-meeting">Roles in a Meeting</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Chair (Presiding Officer)</strong> – Runs the meeting, ensures rules are followed.</li>
  <li><strong>Timekeeper</strong> - Optional role to assist the chair in sticking to an outline.</li>
  <li><strong>Secretary</strong> – Takes minutes (official notes).</li>
  <li><strong>Members</strong> – Participants who debate and vote.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="order-of-business-meeting-agenda">Order of Business (Meeting Agenda)</h3>

<p>A standard meeting follows this structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Call to Order</strong> – Chair opens the meeting.</li>
  <li><strong>Reading &amp; Approval of Minutes</strong> – Corrections, then approval by vote.</li>
  <li><strong>Reports</strong> – Officers/committees present updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Unfinished Business</strong> – Topics left from the last meeting.</li>
  <li><strong>New Business</strong> – New proposals or discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Announcements</strong> – Upcoming events or reminders.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjournment</strong> – Meeting ends with a motion and vote.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-decisions-motions--voting">Making Decisions (Motions &amp; Voting)</h3>

<p>A <strong>motion</strong> is a formal proposal for action. Basic steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Member rises, is recognized by Chair</strong>, and says: <em>“I move that…”</em></li>
  <li><strong>Another member seconds the motion</strong> (shows support).</li>
  <li><strong>Chair states the motion</strong> for discussion.</li>
  <li><strong>Debate occurs</strong> – Members speak for/against the motion. Must be relevant; no personal attacks. Chair ensures balanced discussion.</li>
  <li><strong>Vote is called</strong> – Majority decides (unless rules require ⅔). Methods: Voice (“Aye”/”No”), show of hands, or ballot.</li>
  <li><strong>Chair announces the result</strong> – “Motion passes/fails.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-motions">Types of Motions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Main Motion</strong> – Proposes a new action (<em>“I move we buy new equipment.”</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Amendment</strong> – Changes a motion (<em>“Add ‘for under $500.’“</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Point of Order</strong> – Corrects a rule violation (<em>“That’s not on the agenda.”</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Appeal</strong> – Challenges the Chair’s ruling (requires vote).</li>
  <li><strong>Table</strong> – Delays a motion to later (<em>“Let’s discuss this next week.”</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Adjourn</strong> – Ends the meeting (<em>“I move to adjourn.”</em>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="debate--decorum">Debate &amp; Decorum</h3>

  <li><strong>Time limits</strong> – Chair may limit long speeches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="voting-rules">Voting Rules</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Majority vote</strong> (&gt;50%) decides most issues.</li>
  <li><strong>2/3 vote</strong> required for major changes (e.g., amending bylaws).</li>
  <li><strong>Abstentions</strong> (not voting) don’t count.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="handling-disagreements">Handling Disagreements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Call for a short recess.</li>
  <li>Remind members to focus on issues, not people.</li>
  <li>Use a vote to resolve disputes.</li>
</ul>
