<h1 id="procurement">Procurement</h1>

<h2 id="resources-in-a-chaotic-world">Resources in a Chaotic World</h2>

<p>Procurement is often misunderstood. To the uninitiated, it might seem like little more than purchasing—buying what’s needed when it’s needed. But within a resilient cadre, Procurement is something far more dynamic: the discipline that transforms scarcity into strategic advantages, logistical hurdles into opportunities for connection, and financial constraints into ways to empower members.</p>

<p>As one of the Four Pillars, the Procurement committee functions as the circulatory system of the community, ensuring the smooth and intelligent flow of resources—material, financial, and informational. If a task involves tracking, managing, facilitating, or strategically acquiring something of value, it falls under Procurement’s domain. From auditing receipts to uncover hidden needs, to navigating legal compliance and orchestrating logistics in a world of disruptions, Procurement is the unseen hand that keeps the community thriving.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>On one side of a continuum, in a <em>shared nothing</em> cadre, Procurement consists of, “What does everyone want for lunch?” or “Let’s make a list with everyone’s contact info.”</p>

<p>The buying club is often a next logical step. Once a month, a team does a run to the nearest large city and fills a van with bulk goods that are dispersed. Procurement here would consist of transportation, purchase, and disbursement of goods. They’d be in charge of bulk purchasing reusable containers like jars, working with Production to fill them, and then handing them out. All while keeping track of who has received what. Then keeping track of who returned their jars for the next disbursement, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>On the far end of the spectrum, in the land of <em>full employment</em>, the strategies described in The Corporate Edge start to become meaningful. In this world, Procurement can take on full-time property management, fund management, accounting, and legal functions. Again, all depending on your context and the specific application of these patterns.</p>

<p>Bearing this continuum in mind, let’s look at core responsibilities that would fall squarely under Procurement’s purview.</p>

<h2 id="core-responsibilities-of-procurement">Core Responsibilities of Procurement</h2>

<h3 id="buying-plans--approval">Buying Plans &amp; Approval</h3>

<p>Procurement creates proposals for beneficial goods or services, which are then voted on and approved by the majority of the cadre. This ensures collective oversight and prevents wasteful spending.</p>

<h3 id="purchasing--order-management">Purchasing &amp; Order Management</h3>

<p>All purchases should flow through Procurement unless another committee is explicitly authorized for special cases. This centralizes accountability and prevents duplicate or conflicting orders.</p>

<h3 id="taxes--accounting">Taxes &amp; Accounting</h3>

<p>Procurement tracks the cadre’s financial health. This includes monitoring account balances, tax obligations, and cash flow to avoid surprises and ensure compliance. Procurement can also have a role in minimizing taxes for individual members of the cadre, see below.</p>

<h3 id="supplier-management">Supplier Management</h3>

<p>Maintaining a vetted supplier database is critical. Procurement evaluates vendors not just on cost but on reliability, ethical practices, and backup options. (For high-risk vendors, the Security committee assists with third-party risk management [TPRM].) Procurement can also curate a vetted list of local farmers, craftspeople, and service providers who align with the cadre’s values, strengthening local economies and supply chains.</p>

<h3 id="inventory-tracking">Inventory Tracking</h3>

<p>Real-time tracking of stock levels, expiration dates, and usage rates is essential. Anticipating needs, like seasonal medical supplies or backup power, prevents shortages. Procurement also manages the establishment and maintenance of discreet, decentralized caches of critical supplies for emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="cost-control--budgeting">Cost Control &amp; Budgeting</h3>

<p>Procurement oversees financial forecasting, cost-benefit analyses, and budget adherence. Every expenditure is scrutinized to determine whether buying, bartering, producing locally, or repairing is the best option.</p>

<h3 id="financial-uplifting">Financial Uplifting</h3>

<p>A cadre cannot thrive if members are trapped in financial hardship. Procurement works with Education to demystify credit, loans, and investments thus ensuring equitable access to resources.</p>

<h3 id="barter-systems--cooperatives">Barter Systems &amp; Cooperatives</h3>

<p>For those with poor credit, Procurement facilitates internal lending circles, skill exchanges, and bulk buying co-ops. Every transaction is documented to ensure fairness and sustainability.</p>

<h3 id="legal-compliance">Legal Compliance</h3>

<p>Procurement navigates contracts, tax laws, zoning rules, and safety regulations, as well as drafting agreements with suppliers or landlords (with input from Education and Security). If the cadre lacks legal expertise, Procurement sources professional help.</p>

<h3 id="logistics--distribution">Logistics &amp; Distribution</h3>

<p>Acquisition is just the start. Procurement also manages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Transportation – auto sharing, community drivers, bike couriers, shared vehicle programs, group transport, or alternative transport solutions like cargo bikes to optimize resource movement and reduce individual costs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storage – redundant, climate-controlled, and with the help of Security…secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distribution – fair protocols during shortages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resource-sharing">Resource Sharing</h3>

<p>Tool libraries, equipment checkouts, and skill exchanges ensure no resource sits idle. Shared assets multiply the cadre’s wealth without increasing consumption. This also includes organizing collaborative events where members can learn to fix broken items, reducing waste and fostering self-sufficiency (in partnership with Production and Education).</p>

<h3 id="technology-management">Technology Management</h3>

<p>Procurement also handles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Device disbursement and tracking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software licenses and subscriptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sourcing durable hardware (mesh networks, 3D printers).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safeguarding against tech failures (with Security’s input).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-audit-as-a-core-function">The Audit as a Core Function</h2>

<p>By analyzing receipts and purchase records (with proper consent and privacy safeguards), Procurement spots recurring expenditures. The critical question then emerges: Could we produce this ourselves?</p>

<p>The cadre can be polled for their core needs as it relates to resilience. This can be done many ways, where committees may be asked to report, individuals can be polled, receipts collected, or financial transactions otherwise examined. Procurement needs to determine where most of the group’s money is going, and then make recommendations (with Production) to inform cadre decisions.</p>

<p>If vegetables are consistently bought from distant suppliers, could Production expand community gardens or invest in greenhouses? If tool repairs drain funds, could Education organize workshops to build those skills? Procurement brings these insights to the wider community, democratizing decisions on where to invest in local capacity. This also includes strategically identifying discarded but usable materials and coordinating their collection for upcycling.</p>

<p>In the above example, Procurement potentially lowers costs for members while increasing resilience, e.g. more food produced in the event shelves go bare. Procurement must always strive for these types of dual-win recommendations.</p>

<p>These audits shift Procurement from a passive buyer to an architect of resilience.</p>

<h2 id="financial-uplifting-in-detail">Financial Uplifting in Detail</h2>

<p>The process begins with an individual in the cadre who has the weakest (or no) credit within the traditional financial system. They provide a credit card to Procurement, or if they lack credit entirely, Procurement assists them in establishing an account and building their financial foundation.</p>

<p>This credit card, possibly “churned” for maximum incentives, is then used to purchase necessary resources for the broader group. The balance is paid off immediately, either through collective dues or shared profits. To ensure accountability, reimbursements are processed instantaneously via written documentation issued by Procurement. Note the importance of this immediate reimbursement, to remove any risk to the card-holder.</p>

<p>Over time, this system can systematically improve the credit of the most financially vulnerable members, ultimately raising the average credit score across the entire group.</p>

<p>The specifics of implementation may vary depending on the cadre’s role and engagement within our crisis continuum. However, the core principle remains: material and financial benefits must be accessible to members as a key incentive.</p>

<p>This is a proven strategy for fraternal organizations like the Shriners, Freemasons, and Elks, who long thrived by offering members increased business opportunities, contracts, and economic advantages. Such pecuniary benefits are a major factor in their enduring success, yet they remain an underutilized tool in modern organizing.</p>

<p>This is an advanced strategy that carries significant risks, including the potential for accumulating debt and creating legal liabilities. It should only be attempted by mature cadres with an airtight operating agreement and a high degree of mutual trust. All participants must fully understand and consent to the risks involved.</p>

<h2 id="enhanced-financial-strategies">Enhanced Financial Strategies</h2>

<p>If things align with your cadre configuration, and you’re creative, there are so many opportunities for financial wizardry:</p>

<h3 id="investing-cadre-cash">Investing Cadre Cash</h3>

<p>Rather than letting surplus cadre funds sit idle, strategically investing them in safer options like short-term bonds can generate additional income. Short-term bonds, while offering lower returns than riskier assets, provide stability and liquidity, making them suitable for preserving capital while earning a modest yield. This approach ensures that the cadre’s financial reserves are not only protected but also contribute to the overall financial health and growth, allowing for greater flexibility in responding to needs or seizing opportunities. From here, we can start to see the beginnings of a sort of sovereign wealth fund.</p>

<h3 id="borrow-against-assets">Borrow Against Assets</h3>

<p>A cadre, as a unified entity, can use its collective assets to secure loans. This might involve using real estate, equipment, or other valuable resources as collateral to obtain financing for significant investments or to bridge temporary cash flow gaps. This strategy allows the cadre to access capital without depleting its immediate funds, enabling large-scale projects or urgent procurements that might otherwise be out of reach. Careful financial planning and risk assessment are crucial to ensure that any borrowing is sustainable and beneficial to the cadre’s long-term objectives.</p>

<h3 id="internal-lending">Internal Lending</h3>

<p>Establish a structured internal lending system where central funds can be loaned to members for specific needs (e.g., micro-enterprises, personal tools, emergencies). Complement this with less formal systems like local currencies or time banks to facilitate internal exchange and strengthen economic ties within the cadre, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. Clear terms and oversight are essential for any such program’s success.</p>

<h3 id="minimizing-taxes">Minimizing Taxes</h3>

<p>Understanding and optimizing tax obligations can significantly impact financial health. This involves more than just filing returns; it encompasses strategic planning to minimize liabilities and maximize eligible deductions, credits, and incentives. By staying informed about tax laws and regulations, the cadre can implement practices that benefit both the organization and its individual members. This might include structuring operations in a tax-efficient manner, identifying opportunities for write-offs related to collective expenses, or leveraging any available tax benefits for community-based initiatives.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Education committee, in collaboration with the Procurement or Security committees, could play a vital role in providing financial literacy and tax education to members. This training could cover personal tax planning, understanding different income streams, and navigating deductions relevant to their involvement with the cadre.</p>

<p>Empowering members with this knowledge helps them make informed financial decisions, potentially leading to increased personal financial comfort and contributing to the economic well-being of the collective. The goal is to ensure that both the cadre as an entity and its individual members are optimizing their tax positions responsibly and effectively.</p>

<h2 id="grant-acquisition-for-climate-resilience">Grant Acquisition for Climate Resilience</h2>

<p>Beyond traditional purchasing and financial management, Procurement plays a vital role in securing external funding to advance the cadre’s climate resilience goals. This includes identifying, applying for, and managing grants that support renewable energy installations, regenerative agriculture, or infrastructure upgrades designed to withstand climate disruptions. By actively pursuing grant opportunities—whether from government programs, private foundations, or corporate sustainability initiatives—Procurement transforms limited internal resources into scalable projects that benefit the entire community. For example, securing funding for solar microgrids not only reduces energy costs but also ensures power autonomy during outages, while grants for rainwater harvesting systems bolster water security in drought-prone regions.</p>

<p>To maximize success, Procurement collaborates with the other committees to craft compelling proposals, align projects with funder priorities, and ensure compliance with reporting requirements. This proactive approach turns grant writing into a strategic tool, enabling the cadre to leapfrog financial constraints and accelerate its transition toward regenerative systems.</p>

<h2 id="im-not-suited-to-this">I’m Not Suited to This!</h2>

<p>One of the core principles of Crisis Cadres is for Education to enable balanced jobs across the organization. Of course there will be individuals who naturally gravitate to Procurement, but every member is expected to pitch in periodically on these roles, as with every other role in the cadre.</p>

<p>This creates a culture of <em>never suggesting things you won’t do yourself</em>, and not expecting others to do things on your behalf. This prevents internal stratification and builds redundancy across the cadre. That way, you’re not always going to be the one stuck taking out the garbage, but on the other hand, you should <em>expect</em> to have to do it as much as anyone else.</p>

<p>Knowledge-balancing across the cadre will come with time, and tasks that seemed insurmountable at first will become easier.</p>

<p>Procurement, in its fullest expression, is the art of weaving together material, financial, informational, and social abundance. It ensures equity, foresight, compliance, and logistical excellence. It turns vulnerabilities into strengths, scarcity into strategy, and isolation into interconnection.</p>
