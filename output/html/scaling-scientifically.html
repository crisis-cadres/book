<p>In the quest for resilient, adaptable, and cohesive cadres, we must first understand and respect human cognitive limits. One of the most significant constraints is Dunbar’s number. Proposed by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, this concept suggests that human groups function optimally when kept below approximately 150 members. Beyond this threshold, trust, communication, and social cohesion begin to degrade forcing the creation of formal, and often less efficient, bureaucracies.</p>

<h2 id="dunbars-number-explained">Dunbar’s Number Explained</h2>

<p>Robin Dunbar’s research began with a simple observation: primate species with larger neocortices formed larger social groups (the neocortex is the brain region responsible for higher-order cognition like language and complex social interaction). Extrapolating to humans, he theorized that our cognitive capacity limits us to maintaining roughly 150 meaningful relationships. Empirical evidence supports this, as the 150-person threshold appears consistently across history:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ancient hunter-gatherer societies typically ranged from 100-150 individuals, after which point, they would split to form new communities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effective military units, from Roman centuries to the modern military company, often hover around this size for optimal cohesion and operational effectiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modern academic specialties and sub-disciplines tend to consist of up to 200 individuals, but rarely more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contemporary researchers have observed the phenomenon in the natural size of personal social media networks and phone call patterns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/image1.jpg" alt="dunbars" /></p>

<p>Dunbar’s number reflects the cognitive load of what Dunbar calls “social grooming”, i.e. the time, mental energy, and emotional investment required to build and maintain trust, reciprocity, and mutual understanding. Beyond this number, relationships tend to become more abstract or superficial, necessitating hierarchies, explicit rules, and formal enforcement mechanisms to compensate for the natural erosion of intimate social bonds.</p>

<p>Dunbar’s research also revealed that our social relationships exist in layers of increasing size and decreasing intimacy: a core of about five intimate bonds, a close support circle of fifteen, a broader group of fifty you cooperate with regularly, and the maximum “tribal” threshold of 150.</p>

<h2 id="why-small-groups-succeed">Why Small Groups Succeed</h2>

<p>This cognitive limit fundamentally shapes how we perceive and interact with others.</p>

<p>In groups under 150, we can genuinely care about and process the complex social realities of our comrades. They are individuals, not statistics. This allows the group to rely primarily on trust, reputation, and shared understanding. Norms are enforced socially through peer accountability, rather than through rigid, bureaucratic rules. Decision-making is more agile and participatory because a baseline of mutual trust already exists.</p>

<p>Once a group grows beyond 150, we begin to lose this innate connection. Other people can become, in a cognitive sense, more like abstract entities. This is why a single, personal tragedy can evoke deep empathy, while news of mass suffering can lead to numbness or detachment. In large organizations, this cognitive barrier requires the introduction of formal rules, clearly defined roles, and explicit enforcement mechanisms. This increases administrative overhead, slows down decision-making, and often reduces flexibility and individual agency.</p>

<h2 id="scaling-through-federation-not-bureaucracy">Scaling Through Federation, Not Bureaucracy</h2>

<p>The challenge, then, is how to grow a resilience movement or build larger networks of cooperation without sacrificing the cohesion and effectiveness inherent in smaller groups. The cadre model, with its committee-based structure, offers a solution that honors Dunbar’s insights:</p>

<h3 id="keep-functional-units-small">1. Keep Functional Units Small</h3>

<p>Each core committee and any specialized committees should keep their active membership well within Dunbar’s relational capacity—ideally around 15-20 active members for highly focused work, and always ensuring the entire immediate cadre stays under the 150 mark. This allows for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Deep trust, familiarity, and psychological safety among members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rapid consensus-building or agile decision-making without excessive procedure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clear accountability based on personal relationships and shared commitment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="structure-communication-in-layers">2. Structure Communication in Layers</h3>

<p>As Dunbar’s work showed<strong>,</strong> our social networks are naturally layered. By structuring communication along these same lines (for example, committee representatives forming a “coordinating council”), groups can manage information flow and coordinate actions at scale without overwhelming individual cognitive capacities. This structure mirrors Dunbar’s layers: a few intimate allies (committee chairs), around 15 close comrades (fellow committee members), about 50 reliable acquaintances (cross-committee contacts), and up to 150 members of the broader cadre.</p>

<h3 id="federate-dont-centralize">3. Federate, Don’t Centralize</h3>

<p>When a community or movement grows beyond the 150-person threshold, rather than creating a monolithic, unwieldy bureaucracy, it should encourage the formation of new, semi-autonomous cadres, each operating under Dunbar’s limit. These cadres can then confederate through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shared Principles and Protocols<strong>:</strong> A common ethos, shared operational standards, and mutual aid pacts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rotating Delegates<strong>:</strong> Representatives from each cadre can form a council for inter-cadre coordination, with roles rotated to prevent the permanent centralization of power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modular Redundancy<strong>:</strong> The network is designed so that the failure or success of one cadre does not automatically collapse or dictate the fate of others. Each cadre remains a resilient unit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This federated model mirrors successful historical examples, such as the Iroquois Confederacy, certain anarchist collectives, and modern cooperative networks like Mondragon.</p>

<h2 id="small-enough-to-trust-connected-enough-to-endure">Small Enough to Trust, Connected Enough to Endure</h2>

<p>Dunbar’s Number is not a rigid cap but a fundamental design principle for any human enterprise. By keeping functional units human-scale, and by scaling through confederation rather than centralization, resilience movements can build agility and deep trust, ensuring that every individual operates within a community where relationships are real and mutual support is a lived reality. The cadre’s committee structure is a practical application of this principle, ensuring that even within larger networks, the vital work of resilience happens in groups where people truly know and count on each other. The most durable structures are those that respect both our human strengths and our cognitive limits.</p>
