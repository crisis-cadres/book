<h1 id="security">Security</h1>

<p>The Security committee’s role varies more than any other, shaping perceptions of its members as either paranoid or prescient depending on the crisis stage. It is the shield against chaos. Its purpose is to graduate from basic preparedness to a professionalized community defense model as circumstances require. For an advanced cadre operating in a high-threat environment, this means cultivating disciplined vigilance, strategic deterrence, and the reputation of a cohesive, highly competent group. This is achieved through rigorous training and unwavering adherence to protocol. Security begins with mundane foundations but scales to meet survival needs, always prioritizing community defense over offensive force.</p>

<h2 id="foundations">Foundations</h2>

<p>Starting from basic principles, a shared-nothing mandate for Security can begin around things like call trees or neighborhood watch initiatives. It’s possible many Security committees only act in a “what if?” capacity, to produce recommendations for more concrete actions by other committees.</p>

<p>A cadre focused on establishing a community garden might see Security concerned with deer fencing and pest control. Maybe a place for garden tools to get locked up, or a closed circuit camera for monitoring around a storefront or workshop. Security doesn’t have to be a gathering of gun-nuts and individualists.</p>

<h2 id="core-responsibilities">Core Responsibilities</h2>

<h3 id="site-hardening-and-asset-protection">Site Hardening and Asset Protection</h3>

<p>This involves practical, preventative measures. The committee will audit community spaces and organize collective work parties to install motion-sensor lights, reinforce locks on shared storage, and clearly delineate private vs. communal areas. Protecting resources includes securing the products of Production and Procurement from theft, spoilage, and pests through locked storage and proper long-term food preservation techniques like carbon dioxide or vacuum packing, as well as integrated pest management.</p>

<h3 id="opsec--communication-resilience">OPSEC &amp; Communication Resilience</h3>

<p>Maintaining operational security is a key concern when the social contract begins to fray. This involves secure communication protocols (encrypted messaging, code words), proper password hygiene for shared digital assets, and discretion about group resources and plans. This includes seemingly simple things like securely managing passwords for common accounts. Security is also responsible for establishing and maintaining redundant communication networks, such as radio and other communications, runners, and organized observation protocols. Digital security and communication resilience training should cover cybersecurity, encrypted communication tools, mesh networks, and radio operation.</p>

<h3 id="self-defense-training-with-education">Self-Defense Training (with Education)</h3>

<p>To maintain balanced jobs across the cadre, everyone should have at least some Security training. This balance prevents stratification, such as a “warrior caste” from forming within the cadre, and empowers everyone to take common defense into their own hands. Physical fitness regimes, sport shooting, martial arts training, and more are all the purview of security-focused educators. Community defense workshops should emphasize de-escalation techniques, followed by appropriate physical self-defense and group defense tactics (non-aggressive, protective posture).</p>

<h3 id="operational-discipline">Operational Discipline</h3>

<p>Security is concerned with establishing a clear chain of command in the field. While cadres might operate in a fairly horizontal or egalitarian structure in a committee setting or cadre-wide meeting, in a disaster recovery situation, things necessarily shift into a field-command structure. A sense of professionalism and discipline should be cultivated to make sure everyone is operating as a cohesive unit. Emergency response team development can involve training specialized teams for fire suppression, search and rescue, and disaster medical triage. Scenario-based crisis simulations can provide immersive drills testing responses to complex, multi-day crisis scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="cultivating-deterrence--defensive-strategies">Cultivating Deterrence &amp; Defensive Strategies</h3>

<p>A resilient community prevents threats by minimizing opportunity. Deterrence is achieved through quiet competence and visible organization, not through posturing or intimidation. Deterrence is about perception as much as capability. The goal is to project an image of competence and cohesion that makes potential troublemakers think twice. A unified and professional appearance is a key element of deterrence in a high-threat environment. Standardized, functional gear, with a possible inclusion of patches or accolades, serves two purposes: it ensures every member is properly equipped for their role, and it signals to outsiders that the group is organized, disciplined, and serious. This projects a sense of cohesion that can deter opportunistic threats.</p>

<p>Disaster drills, advanced first aid practice, organized martial arts, or self-defense sessions must hone cadre capabilities without embracing a culture of militarism.</p>

<h3 id="determining-defensive-posture-and-strategies">Determining Defensive Posture and Strategies</h3>

<p>Security, as a guiding concept, should emphasize internal safeguarding rather than external force projection—defense over dominance. Cadres are not expeditionary forces that go out raiding, but instead remain calm and collected to defend home base. Until someone trespasses or otherwise impedes resilience efforts. Then a decisive and overwhelming defensive response is employed to neutralize the threat, and defend the means of survival.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like roleplaying, recognize that we live in a privileged time or place in history to not be currently in a dicey security situation. As William Gibson famously said, “The future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed.”</p>

<p>As a cadre matures or the external environment becomes less stable, the scope of security planning must evolve accordingly. The following strategies are for advanced cadres operating in high-threat environments or planning for far-continuum crisis scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="defensive-strategy-analysis">Defensive Strategy Analysis</h2>

<p>It’s important for later stage Security committees to study and glean what they can from recent military conflicts. When studying conflicts to clarify an effective defensive strategy, one must be careful not to glorify war in any way. By fully embracing the ethos of Political Compartmentalization, cadres should be able to avoid moralizing, and focus strictly on the material factors that lead to success and failure in both guerilla and near-peer wars.</p>

<p>The largest contributor to battlefield casualties by far in recent conflicts have been cheap and plentiful consumer-grade drones. Countermeasures like drone netting at a minimum may become critical for a well prepared cadre. An Education and Security joint-sponsored training event to practice shooting sporting clays prepares for this eventually while at the same time being good fun.</p>

<p>Historically, successful defensive strategies against technologically superior adversaries rely on key principles that are adaptable to a cadre’s needs. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Spreading out resources and personnel to avoid a single point of failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using earth-bermed or semi-subterranean structures for protection against both environmental extremes and projectiles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Utilizing terrain, camouflage, and disciplined practices to manage the cadre’s profile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What else can be learned from recent conflicts? What does a successful bombing campaign look like from a force with air superiority? What about effective and ineffective blockades?</p>

<p>Security should strive not to become paranoid “bunker dwellers”, but everything has its time and place along the continuum. Before it’s obviously necessary, Production or Procurement can enable the ability to “go underground” or otherwise harden your physical security posture against drones, mortars, and other forms of remote bombardment. Plus, there’s a side-benefit of achieving cheaper temperature stabilization–basically low energy heating and cooling. Being even partially underground can mean protecting vulnerable populations in a grid-down situation under a heat dome. Earth-bermed or dug-out structures are one of the most obvious dual-win actions cadres can take for future resilience. In places that are prone to heat waves and conflict, it makes sense to make use of relatively cheap earth moving machinery to dig out root-cellar like structures for taking refuge in deadly heat or attack waves.</p>

<h2 id="most-effective-legal-defense">Most Effective Legal Defense</h2>

<p>Security should organize training with the most effective defensive tools that are legally available in their jurisdiction. This could range from high quality pepper spray, impact weapons, bows, or where appropriate firearms or drones. Training must unequivocally emphasize that certain tools can kill, are to be treated with extreme respect, stored securely (e.g., locked up until needed), and used only as a last resort in defense of life. De-escalation is always the primary goal.</p>

<p>Cadres make decisions from a scientific and empirical point of view. This type of thinking, in fact, is the source of their strength. Because of this, the facts and obligations around handling firearms must be looked at objectively. Statistically, firearms are much more likely to cause harm to yourself than provide protection, especially in high-stress situations.</p>

<p>Basically, it’s imperative to maintain secure storage of any dangerous weapon. Armory operation and maintenance is therefore an instrumental goal for Security. Depending how far down the continuum you are, access should be made more convenient, but Security must still establish a robust protocol to keep these implements under lock and key.</p>

<h2 id="on-masculinity-and-youth-engagement">On Masculinity and Youth Engagement</h2>

<p>Scouting’s biggest appeal for many is the involvement of activities like bushcraft and marksmanship. These activities can offer a constructive “masculine” alternative to more toxic social media influences. This energy should be redirected toward the more laudable virtue of protecting the vulnerable (e.g., elderly, disabled) and focused into more hands-on training (shelter-building, survival skills).</p>

<p>The cadres can provide all of this, and offer youth a much needed third-place to blow off steam and learn to generally survive in multiple scenarios. There’s also the opportunity to modernize the most effective parts of scouting by dropping outdated nationalism and religious dogma.</p>

<h2 id="security-endgame">Security Endgame</h2>

<p>When security becomes survival, it becomes necessary to adapt to escalating levels of threats. Extreme scenarios like prolonged collapses, widespread unrest, or direct threats will see Security’s posture transition from one of planning and basic deterrence to one of active defense. This is where development of a disciplined persona of professionalized competence, never cruelty, becomes vital. Cadres must project undeniable strength and a zero-tolerance policy for hostile acts.</p>

<p>This means professionalism over pacifism when instability arises, and making sure any clear threat is dealt with swiftly. Security must control the narrative and the terrain through overt displays of defensive force. Think armed patrols on cadre property, hardened checkpoints, and a psychological edge.</p>

<p>In a scenario where rule of law has collapsed, the cadre’s territory must be considered a controlled area. Security will be responsible for establishing and manning clearly demarcated checkpoints on all access routes. The goal is to professionalize access control without provocation, making it clear that entry is monitored and restricted. Unidentified or hostile groups will be denied entry according to pre-established Rules of Engagement.</p>

<p>It is extremely important to reiterate that offensive conquest is considered off the table. Under these extreme conditions, the cadre must operate under clearly defined rules of engagement. A confirmed, imminent, and unavoidable threat to the life of a cadre member or the community’s survival must be neutralized. The decision to use force is authorized only under pre-defined doctrine, and is to be considered a measure of last resort.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Panic will make things worse. Recently we’ve already seen a rapid geopolitical destabilization in multiple places around the world. This is accelerated in no small part by our crumbling ecological predicament.</p>

<p>The Security Committee’s ultimate goal is not to create a paranoid fortress but to foster a culture of confidence through competence. By blending practical skills, strategic deterrence, a touch of “hard-to-kill” persona, and unwavering commitment to community defense, it ensures the community is too organized, skilled, and resolute to be an easy target. The “edge” is there to protect the peace, so the cadre can focus on building a thriving, just, and sustainable community. In a severe crisis, a community’s survival may depend on its ability to defend itself.</p>
