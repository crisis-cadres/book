<h1 id="production">Production</h1>

<h2 id="engineering-resilience">Engineering Resilience</h2>

<p>The ability to produce life’s necessities is the bedrock of true independence.</p>

<p>Here in North America, we don’t really deal in manufacturing or hard work to produce things of value as much as we used to. In fact, in many ways production is looked down on, despite being essential to resilience and life itself.</p>

<p>Many political or organizing groups falter because they cannot offer their adherents anything tangible. Passion, ideology, and a political landscape increasingly focused on spite cannot mend a broken roof or fill an empty stomach.</p>

<p>If a cadre is to endure—if it is to become more than a fleeting gathering of like-minded individuals—it must provide real, measurable security in a world where scarcity is no longer a distant threat but an encroaching reality.</p>

<p>This is where the Production pillar comes to life. It is the art of transforming raw materials, labor, and knowledge into the things people need most. It is the difference between waiting for the system to fail and building something that cannot fail.</p>

<p>This means focusing relentlessly on essentials.</p>

<h2 id="making-things-people-need">Making Things People Need</h2>

<p>Within Crisis Cadres, Production is not about crafting luxuries, indulging in vanity projects, or chasing profits. Its focus is unambiguous: prioritize what sustains life. Food, water, shelter, energy, tools, medicine—these are the foundations upon which resilience is built. A community that cannot produce them is perpetually one crisis away from collapse.</p>

<p>This principle demands discipline. It means resisting the allure of non-essential ventures and directing resources toward what truly matters. A garden before a gallery. A workshop before a web app. A functioning water system before anything else.</p>

<p>We stress this point, but not because we imagine it to be profound. It should honestly be instinctive. And yet, modern society often incentivizes the opposite. How much of today’s economy is financialized, detached from real needs? From crypto scams, influencer culture, IP law, endless PR and consulting, multi-level marketing, and other bureaucratic box-ticking. These activities may generate revenue, but they don’t contribute to collective survival.</p>

<p>The results of our production should serve a clear, cadre-determined purpose—otherwise, we’re just decorating our house while the foundation erodes.</p>

<h2 id="engage-in-appropriate-production">Engage in Appropriate Production</h2>

<p>“Appropriate Production” means making what’s needed, with what’s available, without waste. In the case of the cadres, it means prioritizing low energy production, and keeping things small. Often on a smaller scale than would otherwise be the goal in the competitive landscape of capitalism. Production powered by solar energy defies profit-driven logic, and is more sustainable than around the clock production.</p>

<h2 id="the-continuum-of-production">The Continuum of Production</h2>

<p>Like all functions of a cadre, Production exists on a spectrum, scaling with both capacity and necessity.</p>

<p>On a basic level, a fledgling cadre operates on simple productive activities—mending clothes, growing herbs in window sills, patching leaks, and education-heavy tasks like sharing knowledge. These are small acts, but they lay the groundwork for something greater.</p>

<p>A homesteading cadre takes the next step: community gardens that produce staples, or small-scale construction projects that turn salvaged wood into functional goods. Here, the cadre begins to reduce its dependency on external systems.</p>

<p>At the highest level, a <em>full employment</em> cadre operates like a self-sustaining economy unto itself—industrial workshops producing tools, regional trade networks exchanging surplus (with Procurement), large-scale agriculture feeding hundreds, and energy systems that keep the lights on without reliance on a fragile grid.</p>

<p>The goal is always the same: move from dependency to self-sufficiency, one step at a time.</p>

<h2 id="core-responsibilities">Core Responsibilities</h2>

<h3 id="food-production--security">Food Production &amp; Security</h3>

<p>A cadre that depends on grocery stores is one bad harvest, one shipping delay, one economic shock away from hunger. True resilience begins with the ability to feed oneself.</p>

<p>Staple crops—potatoes, beans, grains—must take precedence. They are the foundation of survival, providing the calories and nutrients needed to endure.</p>

<p>Climate-resilient methods include greenhouses to extend growing seasons, drought-resistant crops to weather erratic rains, and rainwater harvesting to guard against dry spells. They buffer against climate unpredictability, extend growing seasons, and can facilitate significant northward expansion of food production.</p>

<p>Furthermore, initiatives like propagating and nursing plants or trees can enhance long-term food security and even generate income. Things like nut trees are in high demand, and their seeds can be purchased and germinated with sporadic work efforts, making for an ideal side project.</p>

<p>Beyond growing, preservation methods like canning, fermenting, and drying are crucial to extending harvests.</p>

<p>Cadres might also explore aquaponics and hydroponics for intensive, space-efficient production, or engage in small-scale animal husbandry for diverse food sources and skills.</p>

<p>Production may also choose to volunteer farm labor to nearby or affiliated growers. This not only builds goodwill and strengthens local food networks, but also provides invaluable hands-on learning for members.</p>

<p><em>If the trucks stopped rolling tomorrow, how long could we feed ourselves?</em></p>

<p>Procurement can secure cheap staples for a shorter term crisis while Production works towards a true caloric insurance policy.</p>

<h3 id="equipment-fabrication-and-restoration">Equipment Fabrication and Restoration</h3>

<p>A society built on disposable goods is a society perpetually at the mercy of those who sell them. Production breaks the cycle of dependency and consumerism by ensuring that tools can be repaired rather than replaced.</p>

<p>A basic workshop, a place for repairs to take place, is a logical first step. Sewing machines can mend torn fabric, and soldering irons can resurrect dead electronics. Beyond repair lies fabrication: blacksmiths and machinists turning scrap metal into usable parts and 3D printers crafting replacement components in lieu of shipping parts across the globe.</p>

<p>Where new materials are scarce, salvage becomes an art (with help from Procurement). Old barrels become rainwater collectors. Discarded pallets become shelving. Broken appliances are stripped for usable wire, gears, and motors. Very little is truly waste, but instead should be thought of as raw material waiting to be reshaped.</p>

<h3 id="shelter--housing">Shelter &amp; Housing</h3>

<p>Housing instability kills resilience. This is perhaps more towards the full employment end of the Crisis Continuum, but a Procurement Audit will almost always reveal the lion’s share of expenses for a cadre going to rent or mortgage.</p>

<p>Low-cost building techniques—earthbag construction, straw bale walls, timber framing—turn local materials into durable homes. Retrofitting existing structures can reinforce them against storms, fires, and power outages. And when disaster strikes, the ability to deploy emergency shelters can mean the difference between survival and suffering.</p>

<h3 id="energy--utilities">Energy &amp; Utilities</h3>

<p>The modern world runs on a fragile web of centralized power. When it fails, you’re literally in the dark.</p>

<p>Decentralized energy reduces vulnerability. Solar panels on rooftops, micro-hydro systems in nearby streams, biogas digesters turning waste into fuel, all are viable options. But true resilience also demands manual backups: hand pumps for water, wood stoves for heat, mechanical tools that operate without electricity. The goal is not to reject modern technology, but to ensure it does not become a single point of failure.</p>

<h3 id="medicine--hygiene">Medicine &amp; Hygiene</h3>

<p>A health crisis can unravel a community faster than any shortage of food.</p>

<p>A medicinal garden is the first line of defense. Yarrow for wounds, willow bark for pain, garlic and elderberry for immunity. Cadres may also choose to cultivate medicinal (and gourmet) mushrooms.</p>

<p>Soap-making and alcohol distillation ensure sanitation, while composting toilets turn waste from a problem into a resource. Stocked first aid kits with sutures, tourniquets, and antibiotics, mean the difference between a treated injury and a life-threatening infection.</p>

<h3 id="things-people-need">Things People Need</h3>

<p>Think about things you <em>have</em> to buy or can’t live without. If you need them, others will too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clothing and footwear</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safety equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transportation services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supplies for babies and children</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elder care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furniture and home goods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plumbing, electrical, and other trades like automotive mechanics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fiber and textiles including things like raw wool and flax</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="production-defuses-scarcity-mentality">Production Defuses Scarcity Mentality</h2>

<p>While scarcity fuels desperation; Production can replace that desperation with security.</p>

<p>Production ensures that communities that have access to food, tools, and shelter need not act out of desperation. Shared workshops distribute the burden of labor. Skill exchanges turn individual weaknesses into collective strengths. And surplus goods—whether extra vegetables, handmade tools, or stored energy—become bargaining chips in trade, transforming resilience into economic leverage.</p>

<h2 id="surplus-as-recruitment">Surplus as Recruitment</h2>

<p>Production should always strive to produce surplus goods as a form of recruitment. Having extra to share with the wider community is an excellent way to speak about the cadre, the work being done, and bring its products to those in need.</p>

<p>A cadre that only produces enough for itself is perhaps merely scraping by, while a cadre that intentionally produces a surplus to share with the wider community builds trust, gains influence, and attracts new members. This is not charity; it is strategic recruitment and the most effective form of outreach.</p>

<h2 id="from-survival-to-sovereignty">From Survival to Sovereignty</h2>

<p>In its highest form, Production does more than meet needs—it generates wealth.</p>

<p>A <em>full employment</em> cadre produces enough to trade: excess food for lumber, tools for medical supplies, renewable energy for labor. Skilled members become assets, their expertise valuable to outsiders. Infrastructure—well-maintained workshops, fertile land, reliable energy systems—appreciates over time, turning the cadre into something more than a survival group. It becomes a self-sustaining node of prosperity.</p>

<p>Production is not usually glamorous. Production can be sweat and blistered hands. It’s hard work, and the truth is, we’re not all accustomed to it. But we must plant seeds today so others may eat tomorrow.</p>

<p>It is also the difference between a group that talks about resilience and one that lives it. Between a community that fears collapse and one that is too busy building to notice.</p>

<h2 id="on-automation">On Automation</h2>

<p>While the initial hype around AI has resulted in frivolous tools like chatbots and image generators, it would be a mistake to completely dismiss the underlying technology. The foundational shift is that for the first time, we can use natural, human language to command complex actions. This breakthrough is revitalizing the field of robotics, pushing it toward embodiment via the fusion of vision, language, and action.</p>

<p>Contrary to dystopian fantasies where billionaires monopolize automation, this technology will almost certainly become more widely accessible. Open-source AI models are already approaching the quality of corporate versions, and hardware is rapidly becoming more affordable. Companies are offering capable humanoid robot chassis for prices well within the reach of a serious, organized cadre.</p>

<p>For a cadre’s Production committee, the implications are staggering. A robot working tirelessly around the clock is a force multiplier of immense potential. It can handle tasks like weeding, planting, harvesting, patrolling, and repairing, freeing human members for strategic work like planning and research. This is how a small group can achieve a high level of self-sufficiency and decouple from fragile supply chains without resorting to soul-crushing, dawn-to-dusk labor.</p>

<p>A romantic or Luddite approach is simply not a viable option, regardless of how morally correct it might be. Technology is a tool, and those who refuse to wield it will be at the mercy of those who do. A forward-looking cadre must be prepared to acquire and deploy this technology swiftly, before states and corporations attempt to control it through sanctions and proprietary systems. Such control efforts are likely to be porous and ultimately fail.</p>

<p>Procurement must monitor the market for robotics platforms and be prepared for acquisition at the moment a feasible solution becomes available. Education must develop the skills to program, maintain, and repair these systems. Security must ensure proper safeguards are in place.</p>

<p>Viewed this way, automation is not a threat but a potential tool for liberation.</p>

<h2 id="the-advantage-of-disregarding-profitability">The Advantage of Disregarding Profitability</h2>

<p>Proposed solutions to climate woes, no matter how promising, are often stuck, and have difficulty receiving funding if there’s no way to make them truly profitable. Unlike profit-driven systems, cadres can prioritize resilience over revenue.</p>

<p>The products of resilience don’t need to be competitive with products sold on global markets. Any difference in price can be considered a <em>resilience premium</em>. This premium reflects the value of local availability when you need something in times of scarcity. This allows cadres to build resilience in spite of profitability specifically because it can be done as a vocation or side project, free of the constraints of profitability. Cadres build camaraderie and skill while creating redundancy against a fragile system. It’s a balancing act for sure, and while there may be times you absolutely need to bring in funds to ensure operations continue, there are times when resilience is its own reward.</p>

<p>In a world where everything is for sale but nothing is secure, <strong>Production is the antidote to dependency.</strong> It is the steady, deliberate act of making sure that when external systems fail, the cadre does not.</p>
