<p>We use the term “militant” not to imply aggression, but to signify an unwavering <em>commitment to reality</em>. Cadres should demonstrate a staunch refusal to tolerate falsehoods that jeopardize survival.</p>

<h3 id="the-irrationality-crisis">The Irrationality Crisis</h3>

<p>We live in an age where absurdities flourish, not because people are unintelligent, as is so often assumed, but because their irrationality is <em>useful</em> to them. To understand why, there’s no better primer than Fred Clark’s 2008 essay <em>False Witnesses</em> (the whole thing is required reading, but I’ll summarize it here).</p>

<p>Clark dissects a pervasive yet rarely named phenomenon: people routinely say things they <em>don’t actually believe</em>. They spread rumors, endorse conspiracy theories, or repeat blatant falsehoods because the act of professing belief serves a social function. The <em>content</em> of the lie doesn’t matter; what matters is the <em>performance</em> of allegiance it signals. When someone shares the decades-old rumor that Procter &amp; Gamble funds Satanism, they’re not making a factual claim, they’re raising a banner. It’s a loyalty test, a way to say, “<em>I am one of you, and I’m willing to say something this ridiculous to prove it.</em>”</p>

<p>Clark initially assumed people spreading the rumor were misinformed and would respond to evidence. Instead, he discovered that many knowingly spread these lies, rejecting facts with hostility. He suggests the rumor’s origin stemmed from rival corporate smear campaigns, psychological comfort, or tribal signaling—but the root cause matters less than the pattern.</p>

<p>The article argues that the persistence of the P&amp;G rumor reflects deeper societal issues. People cling to lies for identity, comfort, or group belonging. Fact-checking alone fails because the rumor’s appeal is emotional, not rational. To counter such myths, we must offer alternatives that fulfill the same psychological needs without relying on falsehoods.</p>

<p>In short, rumors like this persist not because people believe them, but because spreading them serves an emotional and social need. People like feeling morally superior or part of a group. Facts don’t work because the lie isn’t about truth; it’s about identity.</p>

<p>This goes beyond harmless tribalism, and results in a slow-motion societal suicide. The fallout is inevitable. When communities incentivize false witnesses, they sever their own connection to reality. The lies start small but the habit metastasizes. Doubt spreads to previously apolitical topics like vaccines, election fraud, and even the shape of the earth. Eventually, the consequences become unavoidable. A society that tolerates “noble lies” will, in crisis, lose the ability to separate truth from fiction or strategy from superstition.</p>

<p>This problem isn’t getting any less serious as we continue along the crisis continuum. Increased scarcity will increase the likelihood of cults, scams, hate groups, and other yet to be seen but assuredly absurd formations, as people scramble to pinpoint some kind of meaning in the unraveling.</p>

<h3 id="distorting-reality">Distorting Reality</h3>

<p>Rumors and conspiracies let people feel righteous by contrasting themselves against an imagined evil. But this “morality” built on feeling superior by comparing-down to cartoonish villains creates a sick distortion of reality. Those who traffic in these lies gamble with their lives and their loved ones’ survival. And every effort wasted on debunking these obvious lies is an effort stolen from solving real problems.
This is why cadres must treat irrationality as the existential threat it represents. Survival depends on adapting to reality, and adaptation is impossible when your community’s epistemology is poisoned. The antidote will never be persuasion. You can’t win people over via argumentation. However, delivering on the promise of material resilience in a time of crisis will speak louder than any words.</p>

<h3 id="a-militant-application-of-science">A Militant Application of Science</h3>

<p>To build truly antifragile communities, we need organizations that blend the spirit of science with the disciplined defense of a survivalist cadre. Call it Militant Science: a union of rigor and resilience, where evidence is sovereign and irrationality is excluded.
Such groups operate on three principles.
First, they are peaceful but armed for defense. They prioritize resilience and sustainability while recognizing that survival requires the capacity to defend. Security is proactive and threats are assessed using cold data. Force, when used, is measured, precise, and rare.
Second, they balance horizontal organization with rigid command. Decentralized creativity fuels peacetime problem-solving, but crises demand discipline. Subsidiarity governs daily operations (see Governance), while critical decisions follow a clear chain of command.
Third, and most critically, they treat evidence as law. While members are free to hold their own personal beliefs, all cadre-level decisions and strategies must be based on testable, evidence-based principles. We rely on what can be demonstrated and proven, as this provides the most reliable foundation for group survival. No metaphysical proposals should be considered acceptable. Peer-reviewed data sits atop the hierarchy of evidence, followed by empirical observations and provisional expert consensus. Speculation and tradition hold little weight.</p>

<h3 id="this-wont-appeal-to-everyone-and-thats-fine">This Won’t Appeal to Everyone (And That’s Fine)</h3>

<p>The cadre model isn’t for those who traffic in conspiracy or comforting fables. It’s for those who’ve watched one too many crises exacerbated by magical thinking, and understand that false witnesses <em>always</em> reap what they sow. Over time, results will speak: communities that ground decisions in reality will outlast those mired in myth.
A core principle of scientific rigor is the challenging of hypotheses from multiple perspectives. Therefore, a cadre that is a monoculture of thought, background, or experience is scientifically weak, prone to confirmation bias, and ultimately, less resilient. True militant science demands diversity to function.</p>

<h3 id="the-stakes">The Stakes</h3>

<p>The P&amp;G rumor is a microcosm of the larger war on reality, not just against falsehoods, but against the cultural machinery that rewards them. Crisis Cadres are the countervailing force, a bulwark of rationality in a world where survival is increasingly a choice.</p>
