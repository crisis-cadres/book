<h1 id="adding-members">Adding Members</h1>

<p>Membership processes for elite organizations, cooperatives, political groups, and other exclusive clubs vary widely but often share some common elements: sponsorship, vetting, voting thresholds, and sometimes probationary periods. Below are some ways different groups handle membership, including real-world examples where possible. It’s up to your committees (and where you stand on the crisis continuum) to decide which of these principles are worth codifying in your bylaws.</p>

<h2 id="considerations-for-adding-members">Considerations for Adding Members</h2>

<h3 id="sponsorship--nomination">Sponsorship &amp; Nomination</h3>

<p>Most elite groups require a sponsor (current member) to nominate or recommend a candidate. This ensures that new members are vetted by someone already trusted. Many groups require two current members to nominate a candidate. Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society reportedly has existing members select new initiates from the junior class.</p>

<h3 id="vetting--background-checks">Vetting &amp; Background Checks</h3>

<p>Many groups conduct background checks, interviews, or probationary periods. For example, the Augusta National Golf Club (home of The Masters) has a notoriously secretive process, where candidates are vetted for years before being invited. Freemason’s require background checks, interviews, and sometimes a waiting period before initiation.</p>

<h3 id="voting-thresholds">Voting Thresholds</h3>

<p>The voting process varies. Some groups require unanimous consent, which means they require 100% approval and a single veto can cause a candidate to be rejected. Some cooperatives and private clubs require a supermajority (e.g., 2/3 or 3/4), whereas some less exclusive groups require a simple majority of 50% + 1.</p>

<h3 id="easier-to-vote-someone-out">Easier to Vote Someone Out?</h3>

<p>Similar to the principle of recallability discussed in Governance, in many cases some groups have lower thresholds for expulsion than admission. In other groups a supermajority is required for both admission and expulsion.</p>

<h3 id="probationary-periods">Probationary Periods</h3>

<p>Some groups have trial memberships before full acceptance. For example, The Explorers Club requires a sponsor, letters of recommendation, and a waiting period before full membership. Some cooperatives (like housing co-ops) require candidates to live in the community for a trial period before a final vote, and may require financial checks as well. Other groups require a multi-year discernment process before full membership is awarded.</p>

<p>Even if your cadre decides to implement a probationary period, remember to make it a point to make prospective members feel welcome, and allow them to voice their opinions or tell you about themselves. Integrating new members into active projects ensures they feel included and can contribute immediately.</p>

<p>While membership processes vary, one principle should remain non-negotiable: diversity isn’t optional.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-as-a-strategic-imperative">Diversity as a Strategic Imperative</h2>

<p>Just as a thriving forest ecosystem relies on biodiversity to prevent disease, adapt to environmental changes, and sustain complex life, human communities and cadres are strongest, most resilient, and most innovative when they embrace and deliberately cultivate diversity. This isn’t about tokenism or fulfilling abstract quotas, it’s a pragmatic imperative for survival and antifragility. A cadre with diverse skills, backgrounds, and perspectives is better equipped to solve complex problems and navigate turbulent conditions.</p>

<p>There is substantial evidence that diverse teams are more effective. Studies from organizations like McKinsey &amp; Company and Harvard Business Review consistently link increased gender and ethnic diversity to better financial performance and enhanced problem-solving capabilities through a broader range of perspectives and experiences.</p>

<p>A truly resilient organization doesn’t leave representation to chance. It mirrors the demographics of its bioregion—if the local population is composed in a certain way, the cadre should attempt to mirror that reality, or at least strive toward it. In regions where homogeneity is the norm, the cadre must actively seek out global perspectives and connect with global experts. The goal is eliminating dangerous blind spots.</p>

<p>And when homogeneity persists, it shouldn’t go unquestioned. Any cadre, or committee within one, that falls short of reasonable diversity thresholds must justify why and outline steps to correct the imbalance. Exceptions might exist in urgent, specialized cases (such as recruiting a medical professional), but these assignments should be scrutinized and remedied.</p>

<p>Homogenous groups think alike, breeding confirmation bias and groupthink. A farming collective made up solely of urban transplants might miss centuries of Indigenous land wisdom that are vital for survival in local conditions. But a diverse team brings multiple frameworks to a problem, leading to sharper analysis and more innovative solutions.</p>

<p>Exclusion breeds resentment and division, fault lines that can shatter a group under pressure. But when a cadre genuinely reflects and respects the diversity of its community, it builds trust, solidarity, and resilience against external hostility.</p>

<p>A trans refugee, a laid-off auto worker, a Thai rice farmer, and a Silicon Valley engineer will each see different threats and opportunities in a crisis. That breadth of perspective is invaluable. Linguistic diversity, too, is a strategic asset that can bridge gaps with neighboring communities in critical moments.</p>

<h3 id="recruitment-with-purpose">Recruitment with Purpose</h3>

<p>Demographic awareness should guide recruitment, ensuring underrepresented groups have pathways into the cadre. But diversity isn’t just about race or gender, it’s about skills, professions, and life experiences. Artists, scientists, tradespeople, caregivers, elders, and youth all bring unique strengths. When imbalances exist, the cadre must explain why, and take action.</p>

<h3 id="global-networks-local-wisdom">Global Networks, Local Wisdom</h3>

<p>If local diversity is limited, the cadre should forge ties with international groups. A Norwegian cadre might learn dryland farming from a Sahelian collective; a coastal community might study flood resilience from Bangladeshi innovators. Language training, cultural exchange, and shared knowledge turn distant connections into lifelines.</p>

<h3 id="integration-not-tokenism">Integration, Not Tokenism</h3>

<p>Diversity fails when marginalized members are siloed into narrow roles. True integration means distributing leadership, rotating decision-making power, and ensuring all voices shape the cadre’s direction. Dedicated functions can address biases before they erode trust.</p>

<h2 id="the-human-polyculture">The Human Polyculture</h2>

<p>A monoculture is fragile, one blight can destroy it. But a polyculture, with its tangled web of interdependent species, thrives under stress. The same is true for human groups. Diversity must be thought of as a form of risk management, rather than idealism. By weaving demographic, cognitive, and experiential variety into a cadre’s DNA, we guard against intellectual stagnation, social fragility, and strategic blindness.</p>

<p>A resilient cadre is a living ecosystem—strong because it is varied, adaptable because it is inclusive, and antifragile because it is diverse by design.</p>
