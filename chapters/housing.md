# Housing

## Hidden Homes to Greenhouse Villages

Housing has become increasingly expensive, making secure and affordable shelter a primary challenge for most. If Procurement audits expenditures, they will nearly always reveal housing as the single largest financial drain. This reality demands a fundamental rethinking of how we live. Traditional models of individual homeownership and landlord-tenant relationships are increasingly failing to provide stability. Therefore, innovative housing solutions are therefore paramount for any group serious about long-term survival and autonomy.

Housing is the cornerstone of personal and collective security. Dependence on volatile rental markets or crushing mortgage debt creates immense vulnerability. A resilient cadre must therefore strive to:

- Reduce or eliminate recurring housing costs like rent and mortgage payments.
- Integrate housing with life support systems (food, water, and energy).
- Build redundancy and surge capacity for members and allies.
- Create shelter despite restrictive legal frameworks.

## Security Over Sprawl

Before any strategy can succeed, a shift in perspective is required**.** Embracing smaller, more efficient living spaces can dramatically accelerate a cadre's ability to house its members if they choose to do so. By prioritizing functionality and close-knit community over expansive individual dwellings, a cadre can swiftly provide shelter for everyone, often in a single, communal acquisition.

This approach recognizes that mutual aid housing doesn't need to be luxurious; it needs to be secure and dignified. It allows resources to be stretched further, enabling the acquisition of properties that would otherwise be out of reach. This could mean utilizing multi-unit buildings where members have private rooms but share communal living areas, or exploring innovative, compact dwelling designs on a shared property. The key is to foster a culture where members are comfortable with close quarters, recognizing that the collective security and economic freedom far outweigh the desire for excessive personal space.

## Phase One: Immediate Solutions

When legal and affordable housing options are non-existent or deliberately withheld, communities must operate in the liminal spaces of legality. This is a pragmatic recognition of necessity. Derelict properties, forgotten corners, and zoning loopholesâ€”these are the cracks where new ways of living can take root.

### Strategic Re-appropriation

While typically too overtly political, identifying and occupying long-term vacant or derelict properties can provide immediate shelter. This is a high-risk tactic that requires careful research into local laws, strong community solidarity, and a plan for making the space habitable.

### Hidden Dwellings

Camouflaged homes that blend into the landscape or existing structures avoid unwanted attention. This might involve earth-sheltered homes on rural land or, more audaciously, tiny houses or modular units concealed within unassuming structures like barns, warehouses, or even large commercial greenhouses.

### Leveraging Loopholes

In many rural areas, zoning allows for RVs or boats to be parked on private property, both of which can conceal small apartments. In areas with acute housing crises, it's not uncommon to see multiple large box trucks parked on a single property; these often bear the tell-tale signs of housing full-time occupants, a reality local authorities may overlook. Similarly, an agricultural business can legally justify on-site housing for "seasonal workers" or "caretakers."

### Low-Investment Housing

Tents, tipis, or yurts can provide rapid, low-cost shelter, though zoning is often the biggest challenge. Construction with natural, local materials should be prioritized to provide passive heating and cooling.

## Phase Two: The Housing Rollup

Once a foothold is gained, the cadre can begin building long-term stability. The "housing rollup" is a powerful model for this.

The process is simple: Procurement acquires a property (likely with a mortgage) and rents it to cadre members at cost. This rent isn't for profit; it only needs to cover the mortgage, taxes, and upkeep. The resulting cost for members is significantly lower than the market average.

Members are then in a position to pay slightly more than the at-cost rent. This surplus can be reinvested to pay down the principal faster or, depending on market conditions, invested elsewhere if safe returns are projected to outpace the mortgage interest. The Security committee can help weigh this risk.

From here, Procurement systematically chips away at the housing insecurity of its members until every member who wants to be is housed in a cadre property.

## Phase Three: Integrated Communities

With stable housing secured, the vision can expand. Resilient communities don't separate shelter from sustenance. Arable land for food production can and should be intelligently combined with living spaces.

### Greenhouse Villages

Large commercial greenhouses can provide a protected microclimate for both intensive agriculture and small, energy-efficient dwellings. Residents might contribute labor to the agricultural enterprise in exchange for shelter and a share of the produce.

### Reclaiming Space

Even on urban lots, driveways and parking spaces can be turned into areas for gardens and greenhouses, especially if shared transportation resources reduce the need for personal vehicles. This is how we reclaim space for life from the dominance of the car.

### Recycling Derelict Structures

Across any landscape, there are always relatively cheap properties whose low price is due to a derelict building. While most people see a liability and an expensive demolition bill, savvy cadres see a valuable stockpile of resources. Offering to take on the "demolition" yourself, as careful deconstruction, can often save you money on the property's purchase price. The seller gets rid of a problem, and you acquire a valuable cache of building materials.

Old houses, barns, and sheds, particularly those built before the mid-20th century, are often treasure troves. They can contain old-growth wood, which is denser, stronger, and more rot-resistant than anything you can buy today. This lumber has a hidden value that can be easily unlocked. With a simple power planer, you can shave off the weathered gray exterior of old beams and planks to reveal pristine, beautiful wood that's ready for a new life.

It's possible to harvest enough material from a single dilapidated farmhouse or barn to build the structural skeleton and sheathing for a modest new dwelling, like a tiny house. The savings can be immense. Other salvageable materials include metal roofing and siding, corrugated panels, brick and stone from foundations or chimneys, and even doors, windows, and hardware. Sometimes even vinyl siding can be carefully removed and reused.

This approach is the ultimate expression of thrift and sustainability. It's a greener way to build that saves a tremendous amount of cash. When new materials must be purchased for things like wiring, plumbing, or insulation, the goal is to keep the shopping list minimal, using the harvested materials for the bulk of the construction. This is turning blight into shelter through cleverness and sweat equity.

### Agrihoods & Farmsteads

These are communities designed specifically to cluster homes around productive agricultural land, integrating life and labor.

The concepts of the agrihood extends far beyond simple subsistence; for a savvy cadre, they represent a significant financial opportunity. By leveraging its integrated expertise, the cadre can design and build turnkey, future-proof communities and fully-realized ecosystems with integrated food production, water reclamation systems, and decentralized energy grids. These resilient enclaves are immensely attractive to a growing market of anxious but affluent buyers who are desperate to purchase security in an increasingly volatile world. The model is straightforward: develop a pilot community, perfect the systems, and then "flip" the model by building subsequent developments for sale at a significant premium. The premium is for the functional, life-sustaining infrastructure and the social cohesion that traditional real estate cannot offer. In essence, the cadre is selling a fully operational and defensible survival strategy, a product whose value will only appreciate as external systems become more fragile.

## From Sanctuary to Strategy

A cadre with a surplus of secure housing holds immense power. This surplus becomes a strategic tool for outreach, recruitment, and political action.

In line with the principle of Surplus as Recruitment (see Production), having more shelter capacity than immediately needed provides the ability to offer safe, temporary housing to allies displaced by personal crises or larger disasters. Offering a refugee not just a cot in a gym but a home in a prepared community is the kind of direct, powerful organizing that grows a movement.

On the far end of the crisis continuum lies the necessity of holding territory. An advanced cadre can use its resources to strategically influence or even revitalize a small municipality. Strategic acquisitions followed by coordinated migration can give even a small cadre a powerful voice in local government. This can lead to influence over essential emergency services and infrastructure. It doesn't need to be hostile. Presenting a struggling town with a well-thought-out plan to turn an abandoned strip mall into a revenue-generating agri-village with shops, classrooms, and event spaces could be welcomed. Dying towns with empty buildings and desperate governments are perfect targets for this kind of regenerative action.

## Conclusion

Addressing the housing crisis is central to building resilience and resistance. When housing consumes the majority of a person's income, this vulnerability is also potentially a massive opportunity to re-allocate capital toward collective strength while building a solid base of support. By treating housing not as a commodity but as a cornerstone of collective power, cadres can forge pathways to shelter that are secure, affordable, and truly liberating.
