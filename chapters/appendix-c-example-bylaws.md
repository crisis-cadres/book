# Appendix C - Example Bylaws

These bylaws provide a foundational governance framework for a Crisis Cadre, incorporating various principles detailed in this guide. This is in no way a legal document, nor has any of this been reviewed by a lawyer. They are intended as an adaptable template to be modified by each Cadre to fit its specific context, scale, and bioregional needs.

## Article I: Name and Purpose

### Section 1. Name

The name of this organization shall be [Insert Cadre Name], hereinafter referred to as "the Cadre."

### Section 2. Purpose

The Cadre is an egalitarian and organized group dedicated to engineering resilience for its members and the greater community. Our primary purpose is to prepare for and mitigate the effects of climate-induced collapse, institutional failure, disaster, and scarcity through scientific planning, hard work, and unwavering unity. We operate on a foundation of pragmatism and evidence, with the singular goal of building local, adaptive resilience.

## Article II: Membership

### Section 1. Eligibility & Diversity

Membership is open to individuals committed to the Cadre's purpose and principles. The Cadre is dedicated to reflecting the diversity of its bioregion and will actively work to recruit members from varied backgrounds, skills, and life experiences to avoid groupthink and enhance problem-solving capabilities]. Homogenous membership must be justified and accompanied by a plan to correct the imbalance.

### Section 2. Admission Process

- **Sponsorship:** A prospective member must be sponsored by two (2) current, non-probationary members of the Cadre.

- **Probationary Period:** A prospective member shall undergo a probationary period of three (3) months, during which they are expected to participate in at least one project or committee activity to ensure mutual compatibility.

- **Vetting:** The Education and Security committees may conduct a joint review to ensure the candidate aligns with the Cadre's principles of militant science and does not pose a risk to the group.

- **Vote:** Admission to full membership requires a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote of all non-probationary members via secret ballot during a closed session.

### Section 3. Member Responsibilities

- To actively participate in at least one Core Committee and contribute to Cadre projects and meetings.

- To adhere to the principles of Political Compartmentalization and Militant Science in all Cadre activities.

- To share knowledge and skills willingly, preventing the formation of knowledge silos.

### Section 4. Removal of a Member

- **Recall:** A member may be recalled for failing to uphold their responsibilities or acting against the Cadre's purpose. A motion for recall can be initiated by any three (3) members.

- **Vote:** Removal of a member requires a simple majority (50% + 1) vote of the full membership, ensuring it is easier to remove a member than to admit one.

## Article III: Governance and Structure

### Section 1. The Four Pillars

The Cadre's work is organized through four interdependent Core Committees, known as the Four Pillars:

- **Procurement:** Manages the acquisition, logistics, and financial stewardship of all resources. This includes budgeting, inventory, trade, and legal compliance.

- **Production:** Creates essential goods and services, transforming raw materials into necessities like food, tools, energy, and shelter.

- **Education:** Cultivates and disseminates the practical skills, critical knowledge, and cultural cohesion necessary for resilience. This includes conflict resolution, member onboarding, and skills audits.

- **Security:** Safeguards the Cadre's members, assets, and operations through risk assessment, contingency planning, and community defense with a defensive posture.

### Section 2. Subsidiarity

Decisions shall be made at the lowest competent and practical level. Committees are empowered to act autonomously within their domains, referring only matters of Cadre-wide policy or significant resource allocation to the General Assembly.

### Section 3. Officers & Role Rotation

- The Cadre shall have a Chair and a Secretary to facilitate meetings. These roles, along with committee chairs, shall be rotated annually via sortition (drawing of lots) to ensure balanced experience and prevent the concentration of power.

- If a randomly selected member is feared to be ineffective in a role, it is a signal for the Education committee to prioritize cross-training.

### Section 4. Recallability

Any elected or appointed officer may be recalled at any time by a one-third (1/3) vote of the membership, with a formal vote for removal requiring a simple majority.

## Article IV: Meetings

### Section 1. Parliamentary Authority

The rules contained in the current edition of _Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (12th Edition)_ shall govern the Cadre in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these bylaws and any special rules of order the Cadre may adopt. Simplified meeting templates (Appendix B) shall be used to ensure efficiency.

### Section 2. General Assembly

A meeting of the full Cadre membership shall be held at least once per month to discuss and vote on major proposals and receive committee reports.

### Section 3. Quorum

A quorum for the General Assembly shall be a simple majority of the total membership.

## Article V: Committee Management

### Section 1. General Principles

- Committees are formed to enhance resilience and operational efficiency by addressing specific, identified needs.

- Committees may be standing (permanent), ad-hoc (temporary), or sub-committees of one of the Four Pillars.

- All committees must operate in alignment with the Cadre's core principles.

### Section 2. Establishment of New Standing Committees

- **Proposal**: Any member may propose the formation of a new standing committee or sub-committee by submitting a written charter to the General Assembly. This charter must outline the committee's purpose, responsibilities, and how it addresses a gap in the Cadre's resilience.

- **Voting Threshold:** The establishment of a new standing committee or sub-committee is a significant structural change and shall require a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote of the members present at a General Assembly.

### Section 3. Establishment of Temporary Committees

- **Types:** Temporary committees, such as Special Purpose or Investigative Committees, may be formed to address a precise, time-bound challenge or crisis.

- **Authorization:** The formation of a temporary committee can be authorized by a **simple majority (50% + 1) vote** at any General Assembly to ensure the Cadre remains agile and responsive.

- **Mandate and Dissolution:** The motion to create a temporary committee must include a clear mandate, a defined timeline, and a "sunset clause" that specifies the conditions under which it will automatically dissolve, such as the completion of its task.

### Section 4. Disbanding Committees

- **Motion to Disband:** A motion to disband any standing committee may be brought to the General Assembly if its function is deemed obsolete, redundant, or ineffective.

- **Voting Threshold:** The dissolution of a standing committee shall require a **two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote** of the members present at a General Assembly.

- **Temporary Committees:** Temporary committees shall dissolve automatically as defined by their sunset clause, or by a simple majority vote if their task is completed ahead of schedule.

### Section 5. Committee Assignments and Staffing

- **Distribution of Labor:** Committee assignments shall be distributed among members as evenly as possible to minimize the workload on any single person. The goal is to ensure every committee has at least one member and each person is on as few committees as is feasible.

- **Rotation:** Key roles and committee memberships should be rotated regularly, potentially via sortition, to facilitate skill sharing and prevent stagnation.

## Article VI: Decision-Making

### Section 1. Democratic Centralism

The Cadre operates on the principle of "freedom in deliberation, unity in action". Full and open debate is encouraged _before_ a decision is made. Once a motion is passed by the required majority, all members are expected to support its implementation, regardless of their initial stance.

### Section 2. Voting

Unless otherwise specified, all decisions shall be made by a simple majority vote.

### Section 3. Evidence as Law

In all debates and decisions, evidence is sovereign. Policies must be testable and falsifiable. Peer-reviewed data and empirical observation hold the highest weight, superseding speculation or tradition.

## Article VII: Core Principles

### Section 1. Political Compartmentalization

The Cadre shall consciously sideline distracting partisan and culture-war debates to concentrate on practical, actionable strategies for resilience. Discussion must directly contribute to the Cadre's mission; if it does not build resilience, it is not a matter for the Cadre.

### Section 2. Bioregionalism

The Cadre recognizes that its resilience is tied to the health and logic of its local bioregion. All planning, from production to trade, will be designed in harmony with the local watershed, climate, and ecosystems.

### Section 3. Corporate Camouflage

When necessary for legal or operational security, the Cadre may operate through a formal business entity (e.g., an LLC or corporation) to rent property, hold assets, and manage resources without attracting undue suspicion. The internal operations, however, will remain governed by these bylaws.

## Article VIII: Amendments

These bylaws may be amended at any General Assembly meeting by a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote, provided that the amendment was submitted in writing at the previous regular meeting.

## Article IX: Dissolution

The Cadre may be dissolved by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the entire membership. Upon dissolution, all remaining assets shall be distributed to a non-profit organization whose purpose aligns with resilience, ecology, or mutual aid, as determined by a final majority vote.
