# Appendix B - Meeting Templates

This appendix provides a set of adaptable templates for conducting the essential meetings of a Crisis Cadre. Each template is designed to be efficient, participatory, and aligned with the core principles of the Cadre: democratic centralism, subsidiarity, political compartmentalization, and a commitment to evidence-based action.

Cadres should rotate roles like Chair, Secretary, and Timekeeper to distribute responsibility and build experience across the membership. These templates can be codified in the cadre's bylaws or operating agreement.

## Template 1: General Cadre Assembly

**Purpose:** The primary regular meeting for all Cadre members to receive updates, discuss cross-committee issues, and vote on major proposals. This meeting ensures alignment and reinforces collective governance.

**Frequency:** Monthly or Bi-Monthly.

**Attendees:** All Cadre Members.

**Key Roles:**

- **Chair:** Facilitates the meeting according to Robert's Rules, ensures all voices are heard.
- **Secretary:** Records minutes, tracks motions, and documents action items.
- **Timekeeper:** Enforces agenda time limits to maintain efficiency.

**Agenda:**

1. Call to Order (5 mins) Chair calls the meeting to order.
   - Secretary confirms quorum and records attendance.
   - Approval of the previous meeting's minutes.
2. Committee Reports (20 mins / 5 mins each)

   - **Procurement:** Brief overview of financial health, key acquisitions, and inventory status.

   - Structured debate on new proposals. The Chair enforces speaking limits (e.g., "three before me" rule) to ensure equitable participation.

   _Principle Check: Debate is open and robust, but once a vote is taken, the principle of democratic centralism requires all members to support the outcome._
