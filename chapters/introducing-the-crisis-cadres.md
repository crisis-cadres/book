# Introducing the Crisis Cadres

Crisis Cadres are organizations of like-minded individuals that are collectively focused on providing resilience against whatever form the next crisis takes.

These groups and their capabilities counteract the isolation and distrust bred by scarcity and uncertainty. They foster local self-sufficiency as a buffer against systemic failure.

We'll get into the details of how they operate, but first some definitions.

## What are Cadres?

In politics, a cadre typically refers to a key individual (e.g., activist, leader, or officer) who forms the leadership core of a party, often employed full-time. (Example: "She trained to become a party cadre.")

In organizations, cadre usually refers to a group of trained professionals in key institutional roles (e.g., business, government). (Example: "The company developed a cadre of skilled managers.")

In the military, a cadre is a small permanent unit that serves as the core for expanding a regiment during wartime.

We use cadre for both individuals and groups, with context clarifying meaning. If unclear, "member" specifies an individual.

Individual: "As the only cadre in the village with disaster training, Maria led the flood response."

Group: "The cadre collectively decided the next steps for their agricultural project."

A cadre is thus a highly trained individual or a tightly coordinated group enabling resilient local action.

## The Crisis Continuum

All cadres exist on a continuum.

On one side of the continuum you have our current crises. Assuming you haven't been directly affected by flooding, fires, or other disaster yet, then your struggles might feel like a minor inconvenience. Enduring some smoke during wildfire season is not pleasant, but it's not immediate life and death.

On the opposite end of this continuum, imagine that the cadres are _absolutely necessary for survival_, and their highly specialized training is required to manage dire events.

This book may give you whiplash, in that it goes from talking about dipping a toe in the water of organizing, to full collapse "crisis mode". This includes things like defensive tactics and all members being fully committed to the cadre 24/7. We trust the reader to understand that the cadres can and will adapt their systems to their particular circumstances at the time.

Since crises can range from minor inconveniences to existential threats, your specific needs will dictate varying levels of cadre involvement. It's important to keep that in mind as we move forward. If some of our recommendations sound extreme now, they're not prescribed for your context.

## Key Characteristics

Cadres display leadership and expertise, and develop their specialized knowledge through formal programs and experiential mastery. Members maintain situational awareness, and can guide others effectively. Their training allows them to stay composed in emergencies, direct response efforts, and stabilize a situation. Their discipline and reliability ensure adherence to strong organizational principles, whether ideological, professional, or operational.

A Crisis Cadre is mainly concerned with the question: what are the most likely problems we will encounter, and what are the most effective actions that can be taken to increase group resilience against them?
