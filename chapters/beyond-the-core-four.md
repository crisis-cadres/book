# Beyond the Core Four

## Designing Committees for Enhanced Resilience

The four core committees Production, Procurement, Education, and Security, are the pillars of resilience, ensuring survival and collective well-being. But adopting a truly anti-fragile posture requires adaptation, creativity, and specialization tailored to a community's unique circumstances and evolving needs.

As a cadre matures and deepens its understanding of its environment, new committees or specialized sub-committees may emerge to address nuanced challenges. These groups must form democratically, rooted in identified needs and aligned with the goal of enhancing comprehensive resilience.

What additional committees might your cadre require? The answer depends on local context and anticipated challenges. In addition to the already mentioned Horticulture subcommittee, we present below a menu of potential committees (some practical, some experimental) to consider as your group democratically determines its next steps. These often arise as offshoots of the Four Pillars or as entirely new bodies addressing specific gaps.

## Evolving Committee Areas

Here are some specialized committee areas that often emerge as a cadre develops:

### Health & Wellness

_Evolving from Education/Security_

Focused on comprehensive well-being beyond basic first aid, this area covers medical preparedness (herbal medicine, crisis triage), mental resilience (peer support, stress management), preventative care (nutrition, fitness, hygiene), and disability/accessibility advocacy.

### Housing & Infrastructure

_Evolving from Production_

Secure, sustainable, and communal shelter solutions fall under this domain, including sustainable building (tiny homes, earthships), maintenance/repair, energy systems (microgrids, passive heating/cooling), and emergency housing protocols. This committee could also explore community land trust development to collectively acquire and manage land for shared benefit.

### Transportation & Logistics

_Evolving from Procurement_

Ensuring mobility of people and goods while reducing fuel dependence involves bike/pedestrian networks, vehicle cooperatives (shared electric vehicles), supply route planning, and fuel reserve management.

### Communication & Technology

_From Multiple Committees_

Reliable communication demands redundancy—mesh networks, radio, offline archives, low-powered computing, and cybersecurity.

### Ecology & Land Stewardship

_Evolving from Production_

Healing and maintaining local ecosystems encompasses rewilding, water management (rain catchment, greywater systems), fire mitigation, and soil regeneration.

### Hospitality & Integration

_Offshoot of Education/Security_

Managing interactions with newcomers and allies covers member onboarding, visitor protocols, refugee support, and cultural exchange. This committee could also organize resilience gatherings combining skill-sharing, barter fairs, community feasts, and cultural activities to foster community cohesion.

### Scavenger & Salvage

_Offshoot of Procurement/Production_

Retrieving materials from junkyards and abandoned sites, repurposing scrap, and mapping local resources.

## Committee Models and Functions

Governance becomes easier when committees are tailored to their roles. Some exist to uncover truths, others to execute urgent tasks, and a few simply to keep essential systems running. Committee structures differ by function—here are the most common forms:

### Investigative Committees

These temporary bodies assemble in response to crises or systemic failures. A post-blackout forensic team dissecting grid vulnerabilities or a group probing a security breach typifies their work. Small and often cross-functional, they rely on audits, interviews, and field assessments to compile evidence. Their power lies in analysis, not action. Once they deliver findings they should disband. Prolonging their existence risks diluting their objectivity or drifting into mission creep.

### Special Purpose and Spin-Off Committees

When a precise, time-bound challenge arises—designing an off-grid refrigeration system, planning wildfire evacuation routes, or developing a radio encryption protocol—these ad-hoc teams take shape. Staffed by experts and volunteers, they operate like task forces: focused, temporary, and laser-aligned to a single goal. If their work reveals an enduring need, they may evolve into standing committees. Otherwise, they dissolve once their mandate is fulfilled, leaving implementation to core groups. These can also be spin-off groups that address activities slightly outside the direct purview of a politically compartmentalized cadre, such as a focused team for a specific, non-recurring project.

### Empowered Committees

In emergencies, bureaucracy can be fatal. Empowered committees cut through it. Granted elevated authority by group consensus, they make real-time calls on resource allocation or policy—medics on a triage committee during a pandemic, for example, might bypass standard protocols to save lives. Their autonomy is balanced by transparency measures like decision logs, post-crisis reviews, and sunset clauses that prevent overreach. When the emergency fades, so does their exceptional power.

### Limited-Function Committees

Not every task demands innovation. Water testing, tool repairs, seed bank stewardship—these repetitive but vital jobs fall to rotating teams with minimal meetings and checklist-driven workflows. They exist to maintain, not reinvent, often reporting to a larger committee (a bicycle repair collective might feed into Procurement). Their value is subtle but critical, and they can free skilled members for complex work while ensuring mundane necessities aren't neglected.

### Hybrid Committees

Some problems refuse to stay in silos. Food security, climate adaptation, and public safety sprawl across domains, demanding collaboration between committees. Hybrid groups merge representatives from relevant pillars, plus outside advisors. They typically align initiatives, rather than outright command a course of action, which helps to bridge expertise across committees. For example, a "Health" initiative might span an organization by having Security handle first aid, Production herbal medicine, and Education mental health. This structure is also ideal for coordinating inter-group drills with other resilience groups for joint training and support agreements. Without concrete deliverables, though, hybrid committees risk becoming forums for debate rather than engines of action.

## How to Choose? A Democratic Process

New committees must arise from collective needs. In your cadre's General Assembly or Resilience Project Proposal meetings (see Governance), brainstorm needs, prioritize by urgency and impact, and pilot groups temporarily. Rotate roles to prevent burnout, and merge or split teams as required.

Learn from local disasters like storms, earthquakes, and heatwaves to pinpoint gaps. Members can contribute to multiple committees based on capacity.

## Resilience is a Living Experiment

No two cadres will have identical structures, and that's a strength. Start with the Four Pillars, stay flexible, and let necessity guide innovation. The goal is adaptive action, not bureaucracy. These are strategic guidelines rather than rigid rules.
