## Praxis 101: The Bulk Buy

This book makes the case for a future built on pragmatic, organized action. It argues against idealism and for tangible results. But for a group of people who may not know or trust each other, the jump from individual anxiety to a fully functioning cadre can feel immense.

This chapter recommends a single, concrete, repeatable project designed to deliver an immediate material benefit to everyone involved. Its purpose is to teach the Cadre model through action, not discussion. Trust, cohesion, and competence-building are the byproducts of this exercise.

The mission is simple: execute a collective purchase of a staple food to save money. This protocol provides a framework for success.

## Step 1: The Spark

Action begins with a single, clear proposal rooted in practicality. It must be specific, low-risk, and offer an undeniable advantage over individual effort. For example:

_"A local wholesaler sells 25kg bags of rolled oats for a price that is 40% cheaper per kilo than the grocery store. I propose we pool our money to purchase one or two bags and divide them among ourselves. My goal is for us to get cheaper food by buying together."_

This proposal is effective because it is not about ideology. It's about saving money. It is a tangible, measurable goal that requires cooperation to achieve. This is a spark from which a cadre can grow.

## Step 2: The Protocol in Action

Once a small group (2-7 people, say) agrees to the proposal, specific tasks must be assigned. These tasks are the functions of the Four Pillars, distilled to their most basic forms. Don't worry about introducing pillar terminology and instead focus only on the work.

### Money & Logistics (Micro-Procurement):

One or two people are responsible for all financial and logistical operations. They must research the final price, calculate each participant's exact share, collect the money, and make the purchase. They are also responsible for transporting the bulk goods from the supplier to a predetermined distribution point. A simple paper or digital spreadsheet is used to track payments and expenses transparently.

It's important to keep things extremely simple to avoid feelings that one person has too much control, and to allay fears of embezzlement. For example, make sure everyone contributes the same amount of money, and the sum total is equal to the number of people multiplied by that individual contribution. Don't get fancy with the money.

In terms of concrete output a purchase is made, the ledger balanced, and the collective assets are delivered.

### Division & Processing (Micro-Production):

A different team is responsible for the physical work of turning the bulk purchase into individual shares. This involves accurately weighing, bagging, and labeling each portion. They must fill food-safe bags or containers. This is a direct act that embodies the core Production principle of "making things people need".

### Communication (Micro-Education):

At least one person is the designated communication hub. Their job is to prevent confusion by ensuring everyone receives clear, timely information. They must communicate the final cost per share, the deadline for payment, and the specific time and location for pickup. This results in a well-informed group, free of the friction caused by poor communication. They would also be tasked with running the after-action review (see below).

### The Storage Task (Micro-Security):

At least one person must provide a secure, dry, and pest-free space to temporarily store the collective goods between their purchase and distribution. This task is about safeguarding the group's shared assets from threat, be it spoilage or theft. In this way, the group's material investment is protected and preserved.

## Step 3: Cementing the Lesson

Once the goods are distributed, the project is complete. However, the mission is not over until the After-Action Review (AAR) is conducted. This is the most critical step for turning a single event into a foundational capability. The review should be brief and focused on evidence.

### AAR Questions:

- Did everyone receive exactly what they paid for?

- Quantitatively, how much money did each person save compared to buying the same amount at retail?

- What was the single biggest friction point or source of confusion in this process?

- If we were to do this again next month, what one specific thing would we do differently to make it faster or easier?

## Step 4: The Bridge from Praxis to Theory

Only after the successful completion of the project and the AAR should the theory be introduced. The facilitator or initiator of the project can optionally frame the group's success within the Crisis Cadre's model, but it is by no means necessary.

This is not to say that organizers should run the cadre's model in secret. Rather, we emphasize the idea that absolutely no grounding in theory of any kind is required to get started coordinating and achieving useful action.

By completing this protocol, your group has moved beyond ideology. You have demonstrated, on a small scale, the core competency of a Crisis Cadre: using organized, collective action to produce a tangible, material benefit. You have engineered a small pocket of resilience. The task now is to build upon this proven, practical foundation.
