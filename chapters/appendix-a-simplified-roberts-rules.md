# Appendix A - Simplified Robert's Rules

Below is a simplified version of **Robert's Rules of Order** condensed into a few pages. This covers the essential principles and procedures for running an efficient and fair meeting.

## Simplified Robert's Rules of Order

### Basic Principles

Robert's Rules of Order is a guide for conducting fair and orderly meetings. Its core principles are:

- **Majority Rule** – Decisions are made by a majority vote (>50%).
- **Minority Rights** – The rights of those who disagree must be protected.
- **Order and Fairness** – Discussions follow structured rules to ensure efficiency.
- **One Thing at a Time** – Only one topic is discussed at once.

### Roles in a Meeting

- **Chair (Presiding Officer)** – Runs the meeting, ensures rules are followed.
- **Timekeeper** - Optional role to assist the chair in sticking to an outline.
- **Secretary** – Takes minutes (official notes).
- **Members** – Participants who debate and vote.

### Order of Business (Meeting Agenda)

A standard meeting follows this structure:

- **Call to Order** – Chair opens the meeting.
- **Reading & Approval of Minutes** – Corrections, then approval by vote.
- **Reports** – Officers/committees present updates.
- **Unfinished Business** – Topics left from the last meeting.
- **New Business** – New proposals or discussions.
- **Announcements** – Upcoming events or reminders.
- **Adjournment** – Meeting ends with a motion and vote.

### Making Decisions (Motions & Voting)

A **motion** is a formal proposal for action. Basic steps:

- **Member rises, is recognized by Chair**, and says: _"I move that…"_
- **Another member seconds the motion** (shows support).
- **Chair states the motion** for discussion.
- **Debate occurs** – Members speak for/against the motion. Must be relevant; no personal attacks. Chair ensures balanced discussion.
- **Vote is called** – Majority decides (unless rules require ⅔). Methods: Voice ("Aye"/"No"), show of hands, or ballot.
- **Chair announces the result** – "Motion passes/fails."

### Types of Motions

- **Main Motion** – Proposes a new action (_"I move we buy new equipment."_)
- **Amendment** – Changes a motion (_"Add ‘for under $500.'"_)
- **Point of Order** – Corrects a rule violation (_"That's not on the agenda."_)
- **Appeal** – Challenges the Chair's ruling (requires vote).
- **Table** – Delays a motion to later (_"Let's discuss this next week."_)
- **Adjourn** – Ends the meeting (_"I move to adjourn."_)

### Debate & Decorum

- **Speak only when recognized by the Chair.**
- **No interrupting** except for urgent points (e.g., _"Point of Order"_).
- **Time limits** – Chair may limit long speeches.

### Voting Rules

- **Majority vote** (>50%) decides most issues.
- **2/3 vote** required for major changes (e.g., amending bylaws).
- **Abstentions** (not voting) don't count.

### Handling Disagreements

If discussion gets heated, the Chair can:

- Call for a short recess.
- Remind members to focus on issues, not people.
- Use a vote to resolve disputes.

### Key Tips

- **Prepare an agenda** and stick to it.
- **Keep discussions focused** – Use motions to structure debate.
- **Follow the rules**, but stay flexible for small groups.
