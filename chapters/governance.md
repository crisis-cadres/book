# Governance

For a resilient cadre to function effectively, particularly under pressure, it requires a governance system that is both participatory and decisive, transparent and efficient. Traditional political systems often oscillate between the extremes of unwieldy bureaucracy, making them slow to adapt, and autocratic rule, which stifles innovation and consent. A cadre's governance, however, must embody the very agility it seeks to cultivate in its response to external challenges. This means establishing clear, adaptable decision-making processes that empower members, leverage expertise, and ensure unified action once a course is set. Key principles include easily recallable representation, the efficiency of such representation over pure consensus, the strategic use of democratic centralism, and a deep respect for subsidiarity.

## Representatives by the Numbers

We know all too well from our lived experiences that representative government doesn't really work. Representative government fails due to money's corrupting influence and misaligned incentives between representatives and constituents.

We can also observe that a pure consensus-based decision making framework is both overly-ideological and ultimately ineffective. Consensus decision making suffers from endless discussions and getting bogged down in process. With Occupy Los Angeles, the group spent more time debating its own decision-making process than advancing its goals, leading to frustration and loss of momentum. Horizontal organizations can suffer from unclear demands or goals, they can be sluggish to respond in a crisis, suffer from tyranny of the minority, and eventually result in declining participation as people burn out.

This is where Crisis Cadres propose striking a key balance between these options. We advocate the use of committee-based representatives, but only while keeping the entire group under Dunbar's number. This allows representatives to act in the well known interests of the wider group, while also conferring the benefits of agility.

To avoid pitfalls, cadres must carefully structure committee assignments.

## Staffing of Committees

It's likely you've already entertained the question of how to assign cadres to committees. Cadres can sit on multiple committees, but there should be an even spread that is intended to limit the maximum amount of work for any one person.

In math, this is a min-max or bottleneck assignment, but in practice, it's simple. You want to assign people to committees such that every committee has at least one member (no committee is empty) and each person is in as few committees as possible (no one is overloaded with memberships).

The goal is to distribute committee memberships among people as evenly as possible, minimizing the number of committees any one person has to join.

Of course there are situations where "linchpin" members might need to hold more committee memberships than average, but this is a strong signal that Education needs to facilitate skill sharing between cadres.

## Sortition

Sortition is "the action of selecting or determining something by the casting or drawing of lots". We've already spoken about the need for cadres to rotate committee positions regularly to facilitate skill sharing as encouraged by Education. Education can suggest direct assignments, or they can be determined randomly via sortition.

Key roles like committee chairs, or officers can be randomly re-assigned via sortition. If there is a fear that a randomly selected cadre would not be effective in certain roles, it can serve as a clear signal to examine the effectiveness of team cross-polination. There are tools like the meeting templates in Appendix B that can help to facilitate skills development across the organization, and prevent the stratification of the cadre.

## Recallability

Generally representatives, or any other authority figures such as officers like the President, Secretary, committee chairs, or media spokespeople, should be recallable. It is usually a good idea to make the threshold for recall lower than that of nomination. Basically, it should be easier to remove someone than to appoint them.

This helps combat stagnation or corruption as entrenched leaders resist necessary reforms or abuse their positions. Easy recall ensures dynamism and responsiveness. In addition to rotation, recallability makes leadership become a temporary duty or a service rendered, rather than a path to personal power. This normalizes turnover and prevents the concentration of authority.

Our schools and workplaces often centralize authority in rigid hierarchies, with commands coming from the top down. If we're going to be successful we need to shift our mindset from leadership by force and domination to one of competence and stewardship.

## Use Robert's Rules

Many of us are already familiar with the so-called Robert's Rules, even if we might not know it by that name. It was first published in 1876, and is basically a distillation of the rules and practice of the United States Congress, tweaked to suit the needs of non-legislative groups.

It has been widely published in various forms as _Robert's Rules of Order,_ a comprehensive guide to parliamentary procedure, a system of rules and customs for conducting meetings and making decisions in an organized manner. It's widely used by various groups, from nonprofit boards to committees, to ensure fair and efficient decision-making. The rules help manage discussions, motions, and voting processes, ensuring that all members have an opportunity to participate and that decisions are made in a structured way.

Robert's Rules provides a framework for conducting orderly meetings, ensuring they are efficient, fair, and productive. It protects the rights of all members to participate, express their opinions, and have their voices heard. It establishes a process for introducing, debating, and voting on motions, leading to clear and decisive outcomes.

Concise editions of Robert's Rules (or the appendix summary) suffice for most cadres.

## Use Bylaws or an Operating Agreement

Each committee, and the cadre overall, can collaboratively develop specific operating agreements or bylaws. These documents codify decision-making processes, voting thresholds, conflict resolution steps, leadership terms, and recall procedures, ensuring transparency and consistency.

Bylaws can spell out procedures for adding new members, or how to handle someone leaving the cadre, procedures for creating new committees, or actions required to perform various tasks. Bylaws can detail anything else your group decides is important. When in doubt, your bylaws can state that procedure for meetings should follow a specific edition of Robert's Rules.

Note that if you're following the guidelines in The Corporate Edge, it can be beneficial to use operating agreements as they're always considered private and do not need to be published externally the way bylaws might be required in certain jurisdictions, such as with cooperatives or non-profit companies.

For a concrete example, see the Example Bylaws in Appendix C.

## Meeting Templates

Using templates can keep meetings on track. Cadres should rotate roles like Chair, Secretary, and Timekeeper (potentially filled by machines if human headcount is low at first) to distribute responsibility and build experience. Some groups might even "gamify" meetings with "action cards" to ensure all necessary points are covered without endless discussion. For example, members might get to play two "objection cards" in a meeting to exhaust their chances to speak for a set amount of time on an issue. Other groups use a rule of "three before me" which means to let at least three other people speak before you speak again.

Consult Appendix B for some examples of several different types of meeting templates.

## Subsidiarity

Empowering those closest to the problem is a foundational principle of effective organization and governance, often referred to as subsidiarity. This concept posits that decisions should be made at the lowest competent and practical level, by those who are most directly affected by and knowledgeable about an issue. This approach harnesses local knowledge, which often leads to better solutions; for instance, a production committee on the ground understands its unique challenges far better than a centralized coordinating council.

Subsidiarity also helps in reducing bureaucratic bottlenecks. By empowering local committees to make autonomous decisions within their designated domains—like an education committee scheduling a workshop or a procurement team placing a routine supply order—it prevents every minor action from having to go through multiple, often slow, layers of approval. This decentralization fosters a greater sense of ownership and accountability, as people with a direct hand in shaping the policies and actions that affect them become more invested in the outcomes and are motivated to see them succeed.

## Democratic Centralism

Beyond sortition and recallability, cadres need a framework for decision-making. To ensure that a cadre can act cohesively once a decision is made, the principle of democratic centralism is crucial. This means that a full and open debate is desirable. All members or relevant committee participants should have the freedom to discuss, debate, and dissent _before_ a decision is finalized. Diverse viewpoints are encouraged to ensure all angles are considered.

Once a decision is democratically reached (through voting or agreed-upon committee protocols), all members are expected to support and implement it, regardless of their initial stance. This prevents factionalism and ensures unified effort. The findings of specialized committees, particularly those based on scientific evidence or deep expertise, should be given significant weight and honored once ratified by the agreed-upon process. This prevents the undermining of expert work by uninformed opinion, while still allowing for periodic review and adaptation if new evidence emerges. Transparency, sunset clauses, and recallable delegates prevent this from devolving into rigidity.

## Breaking Ties

When an issue comes to a democratic standstill, we can apply these principles to break a deadlock. Subsidiarity asks us to weigh the opinions of those closer to the issue. What committee deals with the issue more closely? Which individuals have the most expertise in handling the issue and how did they vote? Is there a scientific consensus around a particular course of action? Is there a meeting template from Education that can be played out to mediate points of contention?

By combining these elements—recallable representation, democratic centralism, parliamentary procedure, meeting templates, sortition, subsidiarity, use of bylaws, and structured, evidence-based decision-making—a cadre can create a governance system that is robust yet flexible, participatory yet capable of decisive action. Keeping group sizes safely under Dunbar's number is the secret sauce that makes representation and empowered committees truly viable. It is a system designed not for power over others, but for building collective power to face shared challenges.
