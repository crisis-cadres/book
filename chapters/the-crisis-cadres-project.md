# The Crisis Cadres Project

This book is a living document. It is not a finished work, delivered on stone tablets from on high and complete in its final form. To treat it that way would go against the very principles it advocates. Resilience is about adaptation. A living document is one that learns, corrects itself, and evolves.

This is where the theory ends and the project begins.

## From Alienation to Action

This guide was not written in a vacuum. It is the product of extensive research into historical resilience, modern organizing principles, and the hard lessons learned from movements that have succeeded and failed. It synthesizes these findings into a coherent, actionable blueprint.

However, no blueprint is perfect. The principles of adaptation and peer review are central to this project's ethos. This guide is intended as a starting point—a well-researched hypothesis to be tested, debated, and improved upon by those who are serious about doing the work. It is intended to motivate us away from feelings of alienation and attempt to inspire community-driven action.

This guide is intended as a spark; the community is the flame.

## A Living Blueprint

With that in mind, this Crisis Cadres guide is being operated as an open-source project. It lives on GitHub, a platform normally used for building software. We are using it to build a blueprint for survival. This choice is deliberate and philosophical.

The principle of Militant Science demands that ideas be tested and challenged. A single author has blind spots. A community of contributors, bringing diverse skills and perspectives, can identify weaknesses and propose better solutions. Peer review is a critical aspect of scientific endeavor. Adaptation must happen in real time as conditions change. As we learn from our successes and failures, this guide must also change. An open-source model allows it to be updated continuously. Finally, this project requires collective ownership. It belongs to the community that builds and uses it, not to one person. By contributing, you are taking ownership of our collective capacity to prepare.

The entire manuscript is available for you to read, critique, and improve. We are looking for contributors to help us forge this tool into something sharper and more effective.

## How to Contribute

You do not need to be a software developer to contribute. The process is straightforward. Think of it as a shared document where you can suggest changes. First, visit the project's main page on GitHub, where the most up-to-date version of this guide will always be located: https://github.com/crisis-cadres/book. When you identify something you want to improve, such as a simple typo, an unclear sentence, a factual error, or an entire section you believe is missing, you can suggest an edit. On the GitHub page for each chapter, there is an "edit" button that looks like a pencil. Clicking this will allow you to make changes directly in your web browser. After making your edit, you will be asked to briefly describe what you did and why. The final step is to submit the "pull request." This is a formal suggestion which sends your proposed changes to the project maintainers, who will review them, possibly discuss them with you, and merge them into the main document if they align with the project's goals.

We are especially looking for field reports and case studies. If you and your group apply a principle from this guide, such as a bulk-buy, a new committee structure, or a security protocol, we want to know what happened. What worked? What failed spectacularly? Evidence from the real world is the most valuable contribution you can make.

## Our Code of Conduct

To ensure this project remains a productive and welcoming space, all contributors are expected to adhere to a simple Code of Conduct. We welcome and encourage contributions from people of all backgrounds, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, age, or ability. Our collaboration is disciplined and mission-focused, not centered on ideological purity.

- All discussions and contributions should be oriented toward the goal of building a practical guide for resilience. We practice Political Compartmentalization here; debates that do not serve the core mission are a distraction.

- It is vital to debate ideas, not people. While disagreement and critical feedback are essential, personal attacks, insults, and harassment are not.

- Criticism is most valuable when it is constructive, so if you identify a flaw, try to propose a solution.

- You should approach discussions with the assumption that other contributors are also here in good faith to build something useful.

- Finally, you must respect boundaries and not share personal information about other contributors without their explicit consent.

Violations of this code will not be tolerated. The project maintainers reserve the right to remove comments, close discussions, and, if necessary, block individuals who consistently disrupt the collaborative environment.

## The Work Begins

This project is a hypothesis: that there are enough people out there who are tired of waiting, tired of the isolating narratives of individualism, and ready to start the hard work of building collective resilience. It’s an attempt to find each other and turn shared anxiety into shared action.

Let’s collaborate on a better future together.
