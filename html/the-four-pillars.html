<h1 id="the-four-pillars">The Four Pillars</h1>

<p>At the heart of a resilient cadre lies a robust organizational structure designed for efficiency, adaptability, and comprehensive preparedness. This structure is built upon Four Pillars, the core committees: <strong>Production</strong>, <strong>Procurement</strong>, <strong>Education</strong>, and <strong>Security</strong>.</p>

<p>Each committee operates with a degree of autonomy within its designated area, yet all are interconnected, forming a interconnected system that addresses the multifaceted challenges of building and maintaining resilience.</p>

<p>This model draws from proven committee-based governance structures used in academia, government, and business. Committees enhance operational efficiency through task specialization and decentralized decision-making where appropriate. By delegating authority to discrete committees, the cadre reduces bureaucratic inertia and avoids the bottlenecks of centralized control, while maintaining cohesive, goal-directed action.</p>

<p>Here we’ll go over the main committees, and their roles. When approaching a new problem, it’s important to repeat the mantra: “Have we considered everything through the lens of Production, Procurement, Education, and Security?”</p>

<h2 id="production">1. Production</h2>

<p>The Production committee is responsible for creating essential goods and services that meet community needs while enhancing total resilience. Its mandate is to create essential goods, reducing reliance on unstable outside systems. This may involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sustainable agriculture and food sovereignty (growing food, preserving harvests, seed saving).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Localized manufacturing and repair (tools, clothing, essential equipment).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Energy resilience (implementing renewable energy solutions).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infrastructure development and maintenance (shelter, water systems).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste and resource cycling (composting, upcycling, material recovery).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, the Production committee is centered on the mantra “make things people need” especially as they contribute to baseline resilience, and always prioritizing tangible, necessary outputs.</p>

<h2 id="procurement">2. Procurement</h2>

<p>The Procurement committee oversees the acquisition, management, and logistical flow of all resources necessary for the cadre’s operations and the community’s well-being. This extends far beyond simple purchasing. It includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Securing supply lines for critical goods not produced internally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establishing trade networks, barter systems, and mutual aid agreements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Management of inventory, strategic stockpiling, and redundancy planning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Financial planning, stewardship, accounting, budgeting, and potentially managing credit or legal compliance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Logistics of transportation, storage, and equitable distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sourcing for salvage, recycling, upcycling, and general reuse of otherwise wasted output.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If it takes place on a spreadsheet, there’s a good chance it’s Procurement’s purview. If a task involves tracking, managing, distributing, or facilitating the flow of resources, material, or finances, it falls under Procurement.</p>

<h2 id="education">3. Education</h2>

<p>The Education committee is responsible for developing the community’s skills and knowledge, ensuring that critical skills and knowledge are deeply embedded, widely shared, and constantly evolving. Its purpose is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Facilitate knowledge transfer through workshops, mentorships, and peer-to-peer exchange.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify skill gaps and develop training programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manage training materials and learning resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foster cognitive resilience, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handle internal communication, outreach, and even media relations with a focus on information sovereignty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Onboard new members to the cadre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nurture social cohesion and assist in conflict resolution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Education is concerned with disseminating the essential information that is needed for all the other committees to function. If essential knowledge is held by only one member, Education ensures that knowledge gets shared across the cadre.</p>

<h2 id="security">4. Security</h2>

<p>The Security committee is tasked with safeguarding the group, its members, and productive resilience efforts against potential disruptions. We are not acting out of fear, but instead trying to foster a culture of confident preparedness. Its functions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Risk assessment, threat analysis, and contingency planning for various scenarios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developing and implementing safety protocols (fire, medical emergency, natural disaster).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organizing community defense measures, emphasizing de-escalation and protective postures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring operational security (OPSEC) for communications and sensitive information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaborating with Education to identify and train members in basic safety and emergency response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protecting physical and digital assets.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These Four Pillars are not rigid silos but interdependent components of a dynamic system. Production provides what is needed; Procurement sources what cannot yet be made and manages resource flows; Education empowers the community with skills and knowledge; and Security protects the entire endeavor.</p>

<p>By breaking down the complex challenge of resilience into these manageable yet interconnected domains, the cadre gains clarity, speed, and depth in its problem-solving, creating a robust framework for enduring crises.</p>

<p>The Four Pillars can be mixed and matched. And not every cadre needs all of them. Different groups might prioritize projects quite differently.</p>

<h2 id="cadre-terms">Cadre Terms</h2>

<p>Now that we have a vague overview of the committees, we have enough lingo to discuss different “shapes” or types of cadres. We can speak broadly about different types of cadres, and their functions, for example, we could say a cadre is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Procurement heavy”</strong> – a traditional buying club or buyers co-op for when shelves go bare or costs for staples continue to rise. To address these challenges, a Procurement-heavy cadre might purchase goods in bulk, divide them up, and distribute them to members at a discount.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Security only”</strong> – this could be something like a neighborhood watch group, or perhaps a marksmanship club or self defense class that meets once a month to improve member skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Production heavy, with a prominent Horticulture sub-committee”</strong> – something like this might be traditionally known as a community garden. More on subcommittees later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Shared Nothing”</strong> – a cadre that does not physically share any resources, tools, housing, etc. A toe in the water of organizing. A low commitment starting point like a neighborhood call tree or social club.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“Fully Employed”</strong> – this is an organization that lives at the opposite extreme from Shared Nothing. All members “work” for the cadre full time in lieu of other employment. Other major services can be provided by the cadre as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**“Full Employment Seeking” **– represents a transitional state where a cadre is working towards the aspirational goal of full employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<strong>Full Housing (Seeking)</strong>” – a cadre where everyone lives in housing provided by the cadre (or working towards it).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="actionable-steps">Actionable Steps</h2>

<p>Let’s get into the kind of activities these cadres are well suited for.</p>

<p>Remember that the cadres exist on a continuum. A “shared nothing” cadre might start with just a dinner club, while a “full employment” cadre is a long-term goal where members work for the organization full-time. Most groups will start small.</p>

<p>When you’re first getting started, “shared nothing” is the default mode of organizing.</p>

<p>People don’t know how to organize. A lot of us don’t even know how to communicate with each other. We don’t know our neighbors and our neighbors might even be scared of each other. Our communities have been in some ways systematically weakened. Take it slowly.</p>

<p>Firstly, organize around disaster preparedness. Think of something easy like creating a “call tree”. Establish a list of everyone who needs to call everyone else to obtain redundant coverage in your neighborhood. Perhaps Procurement can source handheld radios and Security coordinate a plan for usage in an event.</p>

<h2 id="shared-concerns">Shared Concerns</h2>

<p>In the past, there were two major incidents where members of the Salish Sea Cadre lost power for almost a week due to climate related disasters in two completely different parts of the world. In that context, there were the same key concerns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Do we have enough to eat if stores are closed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we have, or can we make enough fresh water? (There are filtration kits that are very cheap and last a long time).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there disabled or elderly people in my community that need to keep warm/cool, power a CPAP, or keep critical medicine refrigerated in order to survive?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Organize around these shared concerns, fears, and threats in your area. Secure the key needs of your cadres and community. Stop worrying about when these things eventually will happen, and instead act. You’ll meet people and connect with others, and perhaps realize you’ve been preparing for more than whatever the current focus is.</p>

<h2 id="early-activities">Early Activities</h2>

<p>Scheduling a regular meeting can be another key action to kick off a new cadre. Consider organizing a potluck dinner. Procurement can determine who needs to bring what and Production can be concerned with making your first meal. We’re organizing now! Can we make extra and give it out or donate surplus?</p>

<p>While Production, Procurement, Education, and Security are the core pillars, cadres will often create specialized sub-committees to focus on specific projects. For example, a Horticulture sub-committee might form under the Production pillar to manage a community garden.</p>

<p>A Horticulture Committee could decide to grow potatoes, since they are a great crop for gardening newbies. They’re a resilient and calorie rich staple food that’s difficult to mess up, and grows easily all over the world, even for people with little in the way of growing skills. You do need to start now, since it can take multiple seasons to perfect the methods to grow anything in your context. Even veteran growers can be thrown off by increasingly common “bad years”, where they’ve grown reliably otherwise. This is where fostering a diversity of crops is important.</p>

<h2 id="high-impact-activities">High-Impact Activities</h2>

<p>Up the crisis continuum we go, and we find that resilience is not a passive state achieved through stockpiling of goods; it is an active, dynamic process built through deliberate practice, robust skill-sharing, strong community bonds, and adaptable systems. The committee-based framework provides an essential organizational structure, however, the true vitality of a resilient community emerges from the diverse range of activities it undertakes. These activities transform ideas into tangible outcomes, fostering self-sufficiency, mutual aid, and the capacity to weather uncertainty.</p>

<p>In the coming chapters, we’ll present a practical and hopefully inspiring list of potential activities that cadres can adapt and implement to strengthen their posture of antifragility.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve outlined the Four Pillars, how do they function in practice? How are decisions made, conflicts resolved, and members assigned? Ahead, we’ll tackle these questions, and dive deeper into each of the roles of each of the Four Pillars.</p>
